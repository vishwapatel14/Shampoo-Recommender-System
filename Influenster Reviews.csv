Scent: The cream boasts a delightful light fruity fragrance that features notes of citrus and apple, making it refreshing without being overpowering. Many users appreciate the pleasant scent, as it adds a sensory element to the hair care routine, allowing for a clean, fresh aroma that lingers throughout the day without clashing with other products or scents. Effectiveness: When it comes to performance, this leave-in conditioning cream excels in taming frizz and adding shine, particularly in humid environments. Users with wavy, curly, or thick hair often report significant improvements in manageability after using the product.

Packaging: The product is packaged in a vibrant green bottle with an orange flip-top cap, reflecting Garnier’s recognizable branding. The design is practical, allowing for easy dispensing of the cream, which is particularly helpful when applying to damp or dry hair. However, some users note that the cap can become messy with use, as the cream may build up around the opening, but this is a minor inconvenience compared to the overall functionality of the packaging. Texture: The texture of the cream is another highlight; it is lightweight yet rich enough to provide ample moisture without feeling heavy or greasy. This allows for smooth application, and it absorbs quickly into the hair, leaving no sticky residue. Instead, users can expect their hair to feel soft, nourished, and manageable after use. The lightweight formula makes it suitable for various hair types, ensuring that even those with finer hair can benefit from its smoothing properties without worrying about weighing their hair down. Value: In terms of value, Garnier Sleek & Shine Leave-In Conditioning Cream is hard to beat. Priced affordably, it offers salon-quality results at a fraction of the cost. A little goes a long way, as only a small amount of the product is needed for each application, meaning a single bottle can last for several weeks or even months, depending on hair length and frequency of use. This makes it an excellent investment for anyone looking to enhance their hair care routine without straining their budget. Overall, Garnier Sleek & Shine Intensely Smooth Leave-In Conditioning Cream is a highly effective product that delivers on its promises of smoothing, shine-enhancing, and frizz control. With a pleasant scent, practical packaging, lightweight texture, and great value, it stands out as a reliable option for anyone seeking to improve the health and appearance of their hair.

Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have repurchased this bottle multiple times because it does a great job keeping my hair conditioned and healthy. I use it every night, and my hair feels soft and smooth in the mornings. I wouldn't say that it's the best thing ever, but I do think it's really great for the price and the amount, and when I just am not sure which conditioner I'm in the mood to use/buy, this is sort of my go-to product. When applying it in the shower, I do often accidentally use too much (based on the amount I usually squeeze out), so I would say that a little goes a long way (or just longer than a lot of other conditioners). However, it is also, at the same time, kind of 'drippy,' in the sense that it can feel watery and will drip down while I'm letting it sit in my hair. For reference, a bottle lasts me about two and a half weeks max, which doesn't sound like much, but my hair is waist-length and I have plenty of it. My hair is so clean, frizz free and super soft, I don't have to wash my hair everyday now and it smells terrific. I also bought the matching conditioner. I highly recommend this set. This product is excellent! It comes in huge bottles and will pump out the amount you need. Each pump bottle is very large and lasts a long time. Leaves hair easier to manage."

Pantene Pro-V Smooth & Sleek Shampoo & Conditioner,5 / 5,"Depuis que j'ai intégré le duo Pantene Pro-V & Sleek Shampoo & Conditioner à ma routine capillaire, mes cheveux n'ont jamais été aussi beaux ! Ce duo est parfait pour celles et ceux qui recherchent des cheveux doux, brillants, et surtout sans frisottis. Dès la première utilisation, j'ai remarqué une différence : mes cheveux étaient non seulement plus lisses, mais aussi hydratés et nourris en profondeur. Le shampooing nettoie en douceur sans alourdir la chevelure, tandis que l'après-shampoing laisse une sensation de légèreté tout en domptant les mèches rebelles. J'ai les cheveux naturellement ondulés, et ce produit m'a vraiment aidé à obtenir un look plus lisse et plus soigné, même sans brushing. De plus, l'odeur est divine et reste délicatement dans les cheveux toute la journée. C'est vraiment un plaisir de l'utiliser ! Pantene Pro-V & Sleek est mon allié parfait pour des cheveux lisses, brillants et sans frisottis. Si vous recherchez une solution efficace pour des cheveux disciplinés, je vous recommande vivement ce duo !"

Garnier Repairing Shampoo Honey Treasures,5 / 5,"Ottimo shampoo. Lava bene i capelli senza aggredirli, già sotto la doccia si possono sentire le sue proprietà addolcenti, io che ho i capelli tendenti al crespo, infatti, li sento subito più morbidi e disciplinati. La profumazione è buonissima, nella stagione fredda, poi, è semplicemente perfetta, una coccola per i capelli strapazzati. Il potere rinforzante è effettivo, aumentato se utilizzato con il balsamo della linea, o ancor meglio con la maschera. L'unico dubbio mi rimane sulla sua delicatezza, infatti mi è capitato alcune volte, dopo il suo utilizzo, di sentire un leggero pizzicore alla cute, andato poi via con i successivi utilizzi. Nonostante questo non ho però riscontrato effettivi latio negativi, e comunque credo che la base per l'uso degli ultra dolce rimanga il saper dosare le quantità di prodotto e variare spesso il loro utilizzo"

Voici quelques aspects à considérer : ### Points positifs : 1. **Prix abordable** : Tresemmé est généralement plus accessible que de nombreuses marques professionnelles, ce qui en fait un bon choix pour un usage quotidien. 2. **Variante de gammes** : La marque propose différentes lignes adaptées à des types de cheveux spécifiques (cheveux secs, gras, colorés, bouclés, etc.), ce qui permet de trouver un produit en fonction des besoins capillaires. 3. **Facilité d’accès** : Les produits Tresemmé sont largement disponibles dans les grandes surfaces, ce qui les rend faciles à acheter. 4. **Formulations avancées** : Certains produits incluent des ingrédients comme la kératine ou l'huile de coco, qui sont réputés pour leurs bienfaits capillaires. ### Points négatifs : 1. **Ingrédients controversés** : Certaines formulations contiennent des sulfates, parabènes ou silicones, qui peuvent ne pas convenir à tout le monde, en particulier pour ceux qui recherchent des produits plus naturels ou pour les cheveux très secs et bouclés. 2. **Effets à long terme** : Quelques utilisateurs ont mentionné que leurs cheveux deviennent secs ou ternes avec un usage prolongé, surtout si les shampoings contiennent beaucoup de produits chimiques. 3. **Pas entièrement naturel** : Contrairement à certaines marques qui se concentrent sur des ingrédients d'origine naturelle, Tresemmé n'a pas nécessairement cette approche. En résumé, Tresemmé est un bon choix pour ceux qui recherchent une solution abordable et pratique, mais si vous avez des préoccupations particulières quant aux ingrédients, il pourrait être utile de regarder plus attentivement les étiquettes ou d’opter pour des alternatives plus douces."

For best results, it is often recommended to follow with Tresemmé Keratin Smooth Conditioner. ### Durability and Effects: The effects of the shampoo, particularly the frizz control and smoothness, can last for several days, especially when used consistently as part of a hair care routine.

Dove Daily Moisture Shampoo,5 / 5,"Thanks to Dove ""Lightness and Moisture"" shampoo, my hair became silky, soft, manageable and acquired an amazing look! I started using Dove shampoos from the first course, and that was 5 years ago! It was very difficult for me to choose a shampoo. My hair: horror, how soft, dry, unruly, frizzy and my main drawback, there is little of it in principle... Previously, I tried a restorative shampoo, my hair was like straw, broke, split... I also bought shampoos for volume, instead of hair I had a shaggy dandelion... The last thing I took was Dove shampoo! I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but with the help of shampoos from this series, my split ends stopped today! The word ""lightness"" scared me in this shampoo. I was afraid that I would have a dandelion on my head, from this lightness, but some trust in this series has already awakened in me, we decided to take it anyway. Dove Shampoo Lightness and Moisturizing: The product is intended for those who need to moisturize their hair. In principle, you can not use additional means for rinsing, but I still use the shampoo together with the Dove ""Volume and Restoration"" conditioner, as the manufacturer advises. The shampoo has an unusual design. It tapers from the bottom to the top. And now the whole yummy part! The consistency of Dove shampoos is divine! It is so soft, medium thick, milky in color. It foams easily even from a small amount of the product. The aroma is delicious, similar to all previous Dove shampoos. It stays on the hair for quite a long time. The shampoo consumption is economical, thanks to good foaming. The foam is gentle, simply the most gentle, instantly envelops the entire head. There is so much foam on the head that I can barely feel the tips of my fingers, massaging my head. And what a thrill it is to massage your head with Dove shampoos... You can plunge from head to toe into this foam, you don’t even want to wash it off, really! Words cannot describe these feelings. The lid snaps on easily, and can be opened without any problems even with wet hands:"

TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"Finally, I tried Keratin Smooth shampoo with keratin straightening effect from TRESemme brand. You know, I really liked it. My slightly damaged Asian hair from lightening has become smooth and saturated as before! A few characteristics: shampoo of white opaque color with a mother-of-pearl sheen. The consistency is liquid, slippery, and looks more like liquid soap. The product has a very pleasant smell, sweetly floral It is very well applied to the hair, easily gets lost in a thick foam. It rinses once, in principle, even conditioner is not needed for trouble-free hair, shampoo perfectly moisturizes the hair even at the tips. What I immediately noticed after the first wash: 1. Easy to comb. The hair does not get tangled at all, it becomes smoother, it does not fluff. 2. Shine. I was afraid to get the effect of dirty, unwashed hair, but this did not happen with Keratin Smooth. The hair really shines, but at the same time it looks clean and well-groomed. My opinion: I don't know how other TRESemme products will behave, but Keratin Smooth shampoo has become my ""excellent student"". A really worthwhile product."

Herbal Essences Smooth Collection Shampoo,5 / 5,"Let me tell you about my experience with Herbal Essences Smooth Collection Shampoo—it's been a game-changer for my hair care routine! 🌿✨ From the first time I used it, I noticed a significant difference in the texture and manageability of my hair. The formula is infused with a blend of rose hips, vitamin E, and jojoba extracts, which work together to nourish and hydrate my hair, leaving it feeling incredibly soft and smooth. Plus, the irresistible floral scent lingers long after I've stepped out of the shower, adding a touch of luxury to my daily routine. One of the things I love most about this shampoo is its ability to tame frizz and flyaways, even on the most humid days. It leaves my hair looking sleek and polished, without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. Another standout feature is its gentle formula, which is free from parabens, silicones, and colorants. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate knowing that I'm not exposing my scalp to any harsh or potentially irritating ingredients. Overall, Herbal Essences Smooth Collection Shampoo has become a must-have in my shower caddy. It delivers salon-quality results at an affordable price, and I love the way it makes my hair look and feel.

Herbal Essences Smooth Collection Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo smells soo good it smells like almost fruity roses. I’ve been using this for most of my life as my mom was a fan of this shampoo too. It cleans really well almost too good borderline stripping . If you have oily hair you’ll love this if your hair is on the dryer side you might not. The price is always pretty good for these I got the matching conditioner and it smells just as good it’s good for detangling but could have better slip. Overall for a shampoo that’s pretty easy to find it’s very good not perfect but good
Herbal Essences Smooth Collection Shampoo,5 / 5,"I wanted to change the shampoo l always use. I think my hair needed a change. I have salon coloured hair, that’s why choosing Herbal Essences classic replenishing shampoo was my choice. Nice light fragrance and lathers up quite well. It is for coloured hair. It’s of a good consistency. I have noticed my hair is a little softer and feels squeaky clean. It is a reasonably priced shampoo that will not break the budget. Would recommend this Herbal Essence shampoo to family and friends. The only thing l found that l don’t like is the construction of the cap, l’ve pulled the cap off the hinge holding it onto the bottle. It never goes back on correctly"

The 2-in-1 formula is super easy to use. Instead of using two products and waiting forever for a conditioner to rinse out, this rinses quickly and cleanly. It manages to not strip the hair and gives it light hydration. This is a must for those of us who aren’t looking to spend a lot of time tending to our hair daily but still want to look nice. If I am having a special occasion, I might try something other than this product for those days, but this is just so easy for the day-to-day. Pleasant scent."

Head & Shoulders Smooth & Silky Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,3 / 5,"I’ve been using this new shampoo for a couple of weeks now, and it’s okay, I guess. The effectiveness is just average; it cleans my hair, but I haven’t noticed any remarkable changes or improvements. The scent is pleasant enough, not too strong or too faint, just there. As for the texture, it’s like most shampoos, maybe a bit creamier, which is nice. The packaging is pretty standard, nothing that stands out on the shelf or in my shower. And when it comes to value for money, it’s reasonably priced, but considering I didn’t find anything special about it, I might try something else next time. It does the job, but I’m not wowed by it."

Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the shampoo my mother uses and loves. It’s easily accessible and is cheap! But you get great quality for such an affordable price tag. This is supposed to improve your hair within the first wash or two: it leaves behind a much softer and silkier hair. It helps minimize frizz and living in the south that is a necessity lol the scent is good and clean/fresh. It doesn’t leave to feminine or masculine it’s a good unisex product. It doesn’t leave my hair oily or greasy or gross at all which is great! I battle with finding a good one that is great for frizz and yet still doesn’t leave the hair too oily or greasy after drying (especially if I don’t want to blow dry it)… this one is it though for a good price. I would definitely recommend to others on a budget looking for good shampoo!

Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo,3 / 5,"I am always on the hunt for affordable, yet effective hair care. I have very thick, wavy hair which is also very dry and tends to break easily. Somebody recommended Suave Keratin Infusion shampoo to me, so I tried it. It smells good, not clinical like some shampoos can. It doesnt lather as much as I like my shampoo to, but after washing my hair my scalp feels fresh and clean, not heavy. My hair feels silky and healthy. But after a day, it feels dry again. I think for thinner hair types itd be great, it just doesnt work exceptionally well with mine."
Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo,4 / 5,I use this and the the smoothing conditioner. It really helps with keeping my crazy hairs tamed.

It's a great product to use without breaking the bank.

In the month I used it for. I picked up the bottles for $6 each at Walmart. Scent was not bad, like coco butter."

Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,"Good quality for a cheaper, drug store shampoo. It helped volumize my fine hair and kept it oil-free for 4-5 days! Normally I’d need to wash my hair every 2-3 days. The scent is very pleasant as well."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,Smells divine and I feel like it does a thorough job with washing my long hair. That said don't know if it does really help with thickening the hair as I haven't seen much difference and if I did it could be due to various factors. It is lovely though.

I am not convinced it is a super effective product, but definitely one very pleasant to use."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,3 / 5,"I bought this shampoo to give a bit of volume and thickness to my limp fine hair. It was underwhelming! It did not give me volume nor any feel of thickness, plus my hiar falls out a lot when using this."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,1 / 5,This shampoo is awful. It has a nice scent but this shampoo gave me frizz and overall dried my hair. Mind you I have Long hair and my ends need to have hydration. I do not recommend this shampoo at all if you have long hair and want a hydrating shampoo.

Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,I recently purchased this after figuring out if this was still causing people’s hair to fall out.

Usually comes in a package with the conditioner, which is an incredible deal."

Tresemme 24 Hour Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair,5 / 5,Voluminous shampoo is an understatement. It works beautifully. It smells good and lasts longer than expected. The texture that my hair feels after is silky smooth. It comes in a very attractive color bottle plus it has the pump dispenser that I like to use in the shower.

Tresemme 24 Hour Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair,3 / 5,This product is ok. I didn't care for the dry feeling the shampoo left when the product was rinsed from my hair. I felt I had to over compensate with the conditioner in order to achieve soft feeling tresses. When air dried the product left a crunchy residue that would go away once brushed. It's not my favorite product but it's not the worst either.
Tresemme 24 Hour Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo has a nice feeling when I’m done and out of the shower. It does have a beautiful volume with a great scent. The 24 hour volume is accurate. I’ve noticed when I wash my hair it lasts for at least 24 to 48 hours. I don’t like to wash my hair every day. But I do shower everyday. So when I just put it up and style it for the day before. It still looks and feels good. The packaging is perfect when you run the shower and want to use it in your hair. I have really long hair so when I’m using this shampoo and have to put more it it’s easy to add more. Just enough. The end result is fantastic.

It works extremely well in removing brassiness. However, you shouldn't use it more than once a week as it can cause dryness. Always follow with a deep conditioner as well. Also note that if you have very light (i.e., level 9 or 10 hair) and you use this frequently it may tint your hair more silvery which is cool if that's what you like!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"Had to get the mini size one for travel as well, because this product is amazing, it those it’s job to clean the scalp as makes your hair look and feel moisturizer"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,"1. BACKGROUND: I used this product from 2016 (summer) to 2018 (fall). My hair is very dark, as I am half Korean, to take me fully blonde it took 2 sessions a week apart (8-12 hrs each) this was done to do as little damage to my hair as possible. (Any unevenness in tone from hair under my ear/base of skull is due to previous bleaching for underlights and color). VIDEO is from 1st session (lost video from second session-red tones are from previous sessions of green/purple/red underlights so it was impossible to go as light as others my go/wish to without EXTREME permanent damage and immediate breakage). 2. REVIEW: This product is very damaging to your hair, my friend has been bleaching her hair for over 12 years, there are much better products. Many people also use this as they believe purple shampoo “kills yellow tones” it helps with orange and BRASSINESS. Use BLUE shampoo if you want to keep more silver/ remove more “yellow tones”. It is cheap, and in images you can see I bleached very light, shimmer lights did kill some brassiness but it did not help as much as blue shampoo would have (it is mis-marketed). Also, after speaking to multiple professional HMUA’s, this is one of the most damaging purple shampoo’s you can purchase. It did more damage overtime and looking back I would have preferred to not use it at all, or use it less than the bottle & brand recommends. My sister has bleached her hair in 2013/14 (underlights and some highlights bordering on an ombré) and a full ombré in 2020 that she occasionally grows out partially then bleaches higher without touching the top which is why the bottle image is small as the bottle is dirty). It has also damaged her hair which is much thicker/denser and darker than mine (she has more curl/Native American recessive genes/and Korean than I do from our mom & great-grandmother-paternal). Regardless we have both suffered more damage from this product and would have used a higher quality, less damaging blue shampoo instead. 3. EDIT: as you can see from my roots in at least 2 images, my hair was a very cool dark brown, commonly mistaken as black (it is not black- my mothers hair is black. In my current profile image I have a lot of red lights that I put some purple dye on- in my profile picture all the bleached hair has been grown out and cut. 4. OTHER INFORMATION: -my hair is lighter from both age & once you bleach the skull your hair will never be as dark as it once was/ the same goes for natural blondes or lighter brunettes if you add darker color to the roots- this is just some extra information I wish I had known at a younger age in case anyone has children/ is looking at products before dying their hair)."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,1 / 5,I did not like this shampoo. I do not think it works at all and it does not smell good. My husband hates it when i use it but i dont want it to go to waste so i still use it but i dont see any difference.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"This is a powerful toning shampoo!! I used to use it every wash but it was very drying and causing quite a bit of damage to my hair. Now I just use it every now and then, or just before going out / to an event. I can leave it in for less than 10 minutes and my hair goes icy blonde and even sometimes a bit purple (which I personally really like)"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,"The purple shampoo really does it’s job, but there is a purple tint to your hair if processed light enough to the point it’s platinum. I know my friend uses it because she likes her hair a light purple color and it works because she is platinum blonde."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"This is my favorite drugstore purple shampoo to use whenever I bleach my hair. It tones the brassiness out of my hair without fail. It is not damaging, smells nice, and lathers beautifully."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"This is great for toning your blonde. I will admit it was a bit drying, but worked great to tone the brassiness when I was blonde."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This is an excellent product to use if you are experiencing brassy or yellow tones to your blonde hair. I use this as a shampoo a few times a week and I also use it on dry hair as a mask. It works perfectly!
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This is the most affordable purple shampoo out there that actually works well. It’s definitely scented but I like the scent.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,1 / 5,"I used this product for a little while because I loved the results it gave me. Little did I know that the entire time I was using it, I was breaking off more hair by the minute. It is so extremely damaging, I switched to the purple shampoo from olaplex!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,2 / 5,"Like my title says, this shampoo tones your hair pretty well. HOWEVER, it makes my hair so dry it is crying for moisture. Wouldn’t really recommend unless you’re in a crunch."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"It's unique and best product that I really love and always want to try, then I found it and have it, now I realize this is the best product i ever used. Try it and see the results. Try and get the best you want. I want to try it again."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo actually works! It brightens my bleached hair so well I went through the entire bottle. It’s very strong and smells great. I usually use once a week. Highly recommend!
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,This was always my go-to purple shampoo as a blonde to remove brassiness and it worked like a charm. I did notice some dryness after having used this but it’s not necessarily for daily use so I never had a problem with that. The scent could definitely use improvement which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"I really enjoyed using this purple shampoo, with other store bought purple shampoos I feel like they have to sit on to tell a different but this one is the opposite it’s fast working and my hair felt nice after using no dryness or irritation definitely recommend!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,this shampoo definitely gets the brassy tones out of blonde hair. if you can get over the smell it is definitely worth it. it does leave the hair feeling very dry (as with most shampoos) but it is overall a good product
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,If you've had an oops and have a little too brassy of hair this is your go to it works great in a few shampoo and doesn't dye your hair
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,’ve purchased many different kinds of hair cleanser/conditioners. I don’t skimp on pricing because you get what you pay for mostly. I’ve been using a name brand for over two years and felt it was time for a change. It was way more costly than this product and I’m shocked at how awesome this product is for the price. They only problem I have now is my hair is so soft a pony tail won’t stay in on day one. This has never been an issue for me.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,2 / 5,I have been using purple shampoo for 12 years now and this is one of the worst ones I have ever tried. It dries out my hair so badly and the purple pigment wasn't strong enough to get rid of the yellow in my hair. I would use a different brand if possible.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,I bought this back when I had silver dye on my hair and it help me with the yellow undertones in my hair. I tried a lot of purple shampoo and found this one worked best for me. My hair is very thin and straight. I found that putting this shampoo before wetting your hair and leaving it for 5-10 minutes (no more than that or your hair will turn purple) will take all of those yellow tones.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,It’s really good to have and a perfect starter if you’re perfecting your blonde. Used after bleaching and while transitioning back to my natural hair. Smaller bottle was good since I use it less frequently now.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This product has a very pleasant smell. I went from yellow orange to blonde platinum in 2 uses. I leave it in my hair for about 15 minutes while I'm doing my other normal hygiene care and when I'm done I rinse it out and use some good conditioner. I love this stuff.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,I used this when I had blonde in my hair to cancel any orange out because of rust water. It works really well and kept my hair the way I wanted it to be so I definitely recommend.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,Took the brasiness away when I bleached my hair then dyed it blonde. Doesn't leave hair too dry and cleanses well. Lasts a long time so I'd recommend
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,Purple shampoo helps my blonde hair shinner and glossy looking. It also helps my hair not look greasy! I rate it 10/10. Perfect for hair!! It keeps my hair looking silky. Best for dry scalp and oily scalp! I am satisfied that it works this good!&nbsp;
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,1 / 5,This was horrible. It dried out my hair and did nothing to color correct. I had to cut all my blond hair off and start fresh with my roots because this destroyed my hair. If I go blond again I will not be using this brand.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,This is a classic for blondes. If you have near white/lightest blonde hair this can dye it lavender. I specifically bought this a year ago to make my hair lavender. You leave it on about 15-20 minutes and you will have lavender/some lavender hues for about 1.5 weeks. I also used this later on as a regular toning shampoo for my blonde hair and it works great. I have tried other purple shampoos that I like better. This is very drying and smells like faint musky cat pee smell with shampoo. Those are my reasons for giving it a 4/5. Of course that scent washes out but it's pretty strong when applying. I think Pravana has the best blonde products.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,I really like this shampoo and it works good!! It smells good and it doesn't stain your scalp or bath tub. It's affordable and you get alot for the price.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,2 / 5,This shampoo did not work for me. It is super watery and didn’t help my hair. Gave off a weird smell and made my hair feel not hydrated at all.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,"Yes, I know that purple shampoo tends to dry out your hair but this one I feel dries it out the MOST. I can appreciate it doing it’s job and removing enough of the brassiness, but I don’t think it’s worth it. No matter what conditioner I use with this shampoo my hair is extra breakable. I’ve switched since then and have had much better luck."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,Been using this for years and it works every time to remove brassiness from the hair. All you do is shampoo and leave on a few minutes and it's gone.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo smells so good! Leaves your hair silky and shiny. No residue left afterwards. Great for dry scalp.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"In the brief moment in time that I had bleached hair, desperately trying to have good-looking blond hair, I used this. It really helped to lift the yellowness out of my hair! I feel like this stuff really worked!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"I purchased this as I highlight my hair and am looking for something to keep it bright and highlights/color looking fresh. I am actually really impressed with this product. My color looks so much better after using but my hair is also super hydrated, soft and silky. After using my husband even asked me if I got my hair done which I did not. I am thinking of just using this full time for my hair as I love it so much. Great product!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,Me encanta este producto porque cuida mi cabello pero sobretodo mi tinte ya que lo he decolorado muchas veces y mi cabello realmente está protegido de resequedad puntas abiertas o quemado . Lo recomiendo al 100% para todas aquellas que necesiten cuidado al rubio.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,I used this product as a toner and it completely turned my hair purple for 2 weeks. That was before cosmetology school. Now I use actual toners. This is good for a at-home use in my opinion
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,It does what it says. It definitely tones the hair. But it is very harsh and drying on the hair. I wouldn't recommend it for this reason.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo is really good for inbetween hair coulour appointments it takes the brass out of my blonde and makes my hair look a bit lighter inbetween colour appointments.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This purple shampoo works beautifully for taking out any brassiness from blonde hair. I only used it once a week for upkeep.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"As a type 4 Natural who has experienced hair loss, im always on the lookout for products that can help repair and strengthen my hair. The Joico K-Pak Hair Line is one that has completely transformed my dry brittle hair. I have to say—it’s a game-changer"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"The shampoo is a restorative one, but we know, right?, that it is not possible to restore hair from shampoo. So why do I take a restorative shampoo? It's simple, I expect the most gentle cleansing from such shampoos, no squeaking of hair and tangling during washing. I need a shampoo that does not turn my hair into a washcloth (yes, shampoos cannot restore hair, but they can certainly worsen its condition). Did Joico K-PAK shampoo live up to my expectations? Yes, and once again, yes! But let's take everything in order. Appearance. Packaging. I have a 300 ml shampoo, so I'll describe it. It is in a gold-colored plastic bottle (typical of the entire restorative line). Nice design, simple but tasteful, one might say in the spirit of professional products. The lid opens easily and closes firmly. Composition and consistency. You can see the composition in the photo. To be honest, I am not very good at compositions, especially in shampoo compositions. It is worth noting that the shampoo contains useful substances: hydrolyzed keratin, evening primrose oil, kukui seed oil... But how effective are these substances in the shampoo, because it is on the hair for literally a few minutes. Nevertheless, thanks to this composition, you can count on gentle hair cleansing. As for the consistency - the shampoo itself is quite thick, creamy. It has a pearlescent color. I would also like to note a very pleasant aroma, it is light, floral, if you smell it directly from the bottle, it seems a little cloying, sweet, but during use I feel only freshness. I can't say whether the aroma of the shampoo remains on the hair, since after that I also use other care products (masks, balms, leave-in products). In principle, there is nothing special about the shampoo, the manufacturer recommends holding the shampoo on your hair for a minute, I did it and then washed it off right away, well, I can’t say that there are any differences in the end. If you have time, then why not hold it on. The shampoo foams well, the first time it may not give a very rich foam, but I always wash my hair twice and the second time the foam turns out great (although the presence of rich foam is not always a guarantee of high-quality cleansing, I have had such shampoos). I apply the shampoo only to the roots, there I whip up the foam (massage) and then rinse it off, that is, the length is washed with just the flowing foam. For me, this method of application is the best, but even if you wash your hair completely with shampoo (I did this a couple of times), the shampoo does nothing bad to your hair, it’s just a matter of habit. I have oily scalp, I wash my hair about once every 2-3 days, the shampoo copes well with pollution, and with this shampoo you don't have to wash your hair more often (this happens with restorative shampoos). As for cleansing, everything is great here) the shampoo gently cleanses the hair, even with quite intensive massage of the roots, the hair does not get tangled, when washing off the shampoo, it seems to smooth out. For me, it is very important that the hair does not get tangled, since then I have to comb it when wet, otherwise I simply will not comb it when dry. Here, I can calmly leave my hair alone after washing and comb it when it is dry. the price is high but it's worth it."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Been on the hunt for a new shampoo will make my hair soft and healthy and hit the jackpot with this one! Lathers super well, love the scent and my hair feels like it’s getting stronger, easier to brush through and is shiny and healthy. I use the conditioner as well and just love how my hair has responded to it. The scent is great too and not overpowering."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,I love smell of this. Leaves hair very shiny. I have a hairstylist friend who immediately knew this was used in my hair from seeing it in person after getting my hair done. The product is on the bigger side but lasts awhile.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,2 / 5,"I have to say I really had high hopes for this! When used, it lathers well but once rinsed, I feel like I need to shampoo again 2 more times. Afterwards my hair is very flat after blow drying with this product."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,3 / 5,"I have curly, dry, frizzy hair that needs moisture. I have used this shampoo and conditioner several times over the years. It does smooth your hair but in my opinion, it weighs my hair down too much to where it’s just flat after being styled."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been using Joico hair care products for years. I honestly don’t have a single negative thing to say about their products! I have very long hair & it has been every color imaginable but yet my hair is in excellent shape due to Joico products. The permanent hair color & the K-pack shampoo/conditioner duo keep my hair soft, shiny but most importantly-healthy!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,It was a nice shampoo to use when I was coloring my hair. It seemed to help add hydration back into it. It was decently priced for the effectiveness of the product.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Shampoo che oltre a detergere la cute in modo delicato, offre al capello un’adeguata e mirata ricostruzione delle parti danneggiate lasciandolo molto morbido e idratato . Profumo fantastico !!!! La Texture è molto cremosa e ne basta una piccola quantità da diluire con un po’ di acqua per una miglior distribuzione."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,The k-pak line is now my HG! This shampoo cleanses my bleached blonde hair so well and my hair is now so soft. Good for curly hair and i recommend the clarifying shampoo as well
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and you only need to use a small amount to get a good lather. I use both the shampoo and conditioner. I have course, thick, wavy long hair and this gives smoothness and shine."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been bleaching my hair consistently for about 4 years so to find a shampoo that not only makes the hair look good, but feel softer too is AMAZING! In love with the Joico K-Pak"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,With this product my hair shine and not frizzy. The shampoo is soft and not aggressive for hair. The price versus the quality is very good. I recommend this product for every type of hair
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Absolutely love this shampoo & conditioner. It was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I have pretty damaged hair from constantly using box dye and she told me about this shampoo and conditioner and it seems to be working 🙂
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I am thrilled to write a five-star review for Joico K-PAK shampoo. As someone who regularly bleaches their hair every 1-3 months, I have been on a constant search for a product that could repair and restore my damaged hair. Joico K-PAK shampoo has been a game-changer in my hair care routine. From the moment I first used this shampoo, I could tell that it was different from any other shampoo I had tried before. Its rich, creamy texture felt luxurious and nourishing on my hair, and the scent was absolutely divine. But what really impressed me was how it transformed my hair over time. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and overall health of my hair. It felt softer, smoother, and more manageable than ever before. And with continued use, my hair has become stronger and more resilient, even after frequent bleaching. I love that this shampoo is formulated with Joico's exclusive Bio-Advanced Peptide Complex, which helps to repair and protect damaged hair. It also contains a blend of antioxidants and vitamins that nourish and strengthen hair from the inside out. Overall, I can't recommend Joico K-PAK shampoo enough. If you have damaged or chemically treated hair like mine, this product is an absolute must-have. It has been crucial in repairing and restoring my hair, and I will continue to use it as a staple in my hair care routine. Five stars all around!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"My hair was in such bad shape, after going to the salon and getting this shampoo recommended, my hair was saved. My hair is softer, so shiny, and overall healthier. I feel like my color lasts longer also but that may just be in my head. Either way it’s my go to shampoo now. I can’t recommend enough if you’re in the market for a new shampoo."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Worked great on my frizz and smells amazing would definitely repurchase. The conditioner is also very great! Keratin treatment who! We don’t need that here. :)
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"LOVE. Love the smell, love how it leaves my hair feeling, love how easy it is to saturate and spread. There will never be a time this isn't in my arsenal for use."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Joico’s K-Pak line is amazing. I’ve been using the shampoo & conditioner for over a decade now (off and on cause I love to try new things as well). The K-Pak line has never failed me and I used to fry my hair like it was an egg on a skillet, with bleach. This line has saved my hair many times and kept it in good condition after chemical treatments, etc. This is something I recommend to anyone who says they have damaged hair. It smells really nice too! I’ve grown attached to the scent cause I’ve used Joico K-Pak for so many years now!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,Very moisturizing and my hair feels great after using it. I don’t use it every time I wash my hair just cz it can weigh it down but I do like to use it every other wash.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Use this Joico shampoo with conditioner and it works great for my damaged hair. I bought this product probably the third time and very happy with it. My hair looks great.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Joico is one of the better brands out there for the professional. I can say that the smell is far better than many shampoo and conditions available. It has a nice light clean smell, without the heavy perfumes. Biolage always reminds me of weeds and I avoid like the plague. K-Pak was designed for repair and does just that. It will feel heavier on hair and if you tend to have oily hair, it's probably not for you. With the conditioner, avoid the scalp. But then again, if you have dry or damaged hair, you probably aren't having issues with oily hair. As with all professional products, buy from a professional and ask for advice. This is a superior brand and works as it's meant to. I highly recommend."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Smells so good !!! Makes your shower a nice treat when it smells this good. Your hair will feel super soft and moisturized with just this shampoo - highly recommend
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"It's no wonder that Joico has already been elected as the best hair care brand in the world. ALL of your products are wonderful. In addition to visibly restoring hair from the first use, the line still smells wonderful. The K-pak line has a delicious and smooth banana scent, in addition to rebuilding, strengthening and nourishing the hair. The mask alone is already a miracle. I have bleached hair and only Joico products recover from chemical damage. If you are insecure, you can buy without fear. if you prefer, buy a travel size to do a test because you will be surprised"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I like because my hair is soft and shine. I have been use Joico , products since 2017 . I can tell you and another’s my hair changes a lot since 2013. I really loved Joico products."

Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve always heard from my hairdresser to never use shampoos from tjmaxx and drug stores as most just use random product and sell it cheap, but if you go to any salon like a jcp salon or ulta ect and check sale sections you spot good finds like this shampoo I ordered last minute while I was out of town!"

Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,I know that when it comes to shampoos and conditioners it can be difficult to find one that works for you and your hair. When it came to the Joico shampoo I felt it did a good job over removing impurities from my hair while still leaving it moisturized. I honestly really liked it and would definitely recommend it for curly hair or wavy hair.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,3 / 5,This shampoo is okay. I think it’s just my hair type but it was a but heavy for what I usually am wanting in my hair. It does well repairing tho so it just depends on what you need! I have fine hair and didn’t love it

L'Oreal Paris Moisture Sulfate Free Shampoo for Dry Hair,3 / 5,I usually LOVE loreal products. Their elvive line has worked great for me. So i figured id give this line a try. While it isnt a bad product by any means i just dont feel it does anything for my hair. My hair doesnt have volume when it dries and i just dont feel like it gets my hair as clean as i would like. Its not awful but its not amazing. On the plus side it is sulfate free and it smells amazing! Just think there are better products for the same price.

L'Oreal Paris Moisture Sulfate Free Shampoo for Dry Hair,2 / 5,"I decided to try this as a friend recommended it for my dry hair. I will mention that it did show pretty immediate results!

The scent is light and lasts a long time.Gentle but thorough cleansing. Left my hair looking and feeling great. I used this brand for a few years. I've recently found something that works better for me (Living Proof No Frizz). In Loreal's defense, I have stubborn fly aways and live in a humid environment and Living Proof is a stronger performer in that department. However, if I found myself unable to obtain or afford Living Proof, I would happily go back to this brand. This works better than many expensive brands I have tried.

The scent is wonderful, it doesn’t disturb. The shampoo surely does its job - my scalp and hair feel fresh and clean. The only thing that I noticed as a downside is that I wouldn’t use it alone, because hair might feel dry. You definitely need to pair it with a conditioner. I used to use it with leave-ins, and the effect was amazing. But several times I used it on its own, and that’s when my hair started to feel a bit dry. So my advice would be to use it in combination with other products."

Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo - Trial & Travel Size,3 / 5,I honestly loved the scent and the cute packaging of this product. Personal I have 2a curls/waves so I was looking for something to enhance that but I feel that yes I did have more refined curls/waves but it left some greasiness to my scalp.

Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,5 / 5,Antiforfora shampoo più balsamo 2 in uno clinicamente testato protegge da forfora al 100 per 100 per uso regolare anti prurito confezione riciclabile
Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,5 / 5,"I suffer from dry scalp in the winter. The typical itchy and sometimes flaky scalp. I also want to mention that I get really oily roots and have hair down to my butt. With that being said I don’t often find products that soothe my scalp without making it oily and keep my ends from taking too much damage. This seems to be a winner! The eucalyptus smells great (I like the earthy plant smells) and feels nice too. When I rinse it, it doesn’t make my ends feel like hay (some other brands do) and it gives you the added bonus of a slight tingle on the scalp. If you haven’t tried this brand or type you should. It’s done wonders for me! I will mention that the directions ask you to leave it in for a few minutes and if I immediately wash it out as you would a regular shampoo, I don’t get the same results. So having the patience to let it sit almost like a conditioner is key here."

Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,Best shampoo I ever use I got the tea tree shampoo it has peppermint tea oil and lavender! Gives a tingling sensation! Love it
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is amazing! My hairdresser has been using it on my hair for as long as I can remember. I took it home & used it but I don't remember the extremely strong smell. The smell is amazing but it smells more of a strong peppermint than tea tree oil. You will definitely pay a good price for the bottles no matter the size but it's worth it! It makes my hair smell so good all day, makes my hair shiny & clean, & glad there is a matching conditioner. But I only use it once a month when I want a really good cleanse as the smell makes me a little dizzy in the shower. I bought mine from Ulta for $16.50!"
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,3 / 5,"Another love/hate affair for me...I like this one because it does actually help reduce my oily scalp and calms my scalp down (probably due to the Tea Tree oil in it), however the dislike is because it's slightly on the harsh side, which is definitely due to the fact that it contains SLS. Rarely does my hair like any shampoo that contains this ingredient, as I end up with hair that feels 'stripped' clean and dry, and not in a good sense! It also contains too much Menthol, and too much peppermint oil - straight out of Pureology's Hydrate Shampoo books. Both brands' shampoos have Peppermint Oil at 6th place in the ingredients list, although unlike Pureology, I don't find my scalp itching as much after using Paul Mitchell's. It also foams less and smells quite refreshing and more natural. However I wouldn't use this long term simply because it doesn't agree with my hair and I end up having to use a hair mask weekly to try and restore my hair to its pre-shampoo state.

Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,I will even add several drops of 100% Tea Tree OIL to the shampoo to get a real nice feeling all over my scalp and let it site for a few minutes. Hair feel clean and dries nicely. Dandruff and that itchiness when it gets hot outside and your scalp sweats comes to an end.
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have struggled with my scalp a lot so I decided to give this a go. I usually have issues with build up and some products end up feeling like they never washed out. This made my hair feel soft, my scalp was less irritated and flaky, so I would say it was a good experience! I only use this maybe once a week or more. I don't use it everyday.

Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,"Unfortunately with the cold weather my scalp gets super dry. Always happens with every winter & every time it does I use this shampoo.

"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",5 / 5,"The best part of friendship is not only the outstretchedhand, nor the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; but it is the inspiration that comes to one when you discover that someone believes in you and will do anything to help you in difficult time, my life was in a great mess after my wife and I got separated and I really needed a place since she had the house, I applied for a house loan but was denied several times due to my poor credit score, I had 12 inquiries, late payments, collection and $53,000 debt on my report, I tried some companies I came across on numerous blogs but was ripped off, so I called my best friend George who directed me to 760PLUS CREDIT SCORE and told me of how they got his grand ma’s credit fixed, so I contacted 760pluscreditscore at gmail dot com also text 304 774 5902 and in just 10days my score jumped back to excellent credit score, they cleared all late payments, collection, inquiries and debt off my report, my FICO score boosted from 519 to 792 all through the process was understanding.

"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",3 / 5,"I started the new year with a resolution to go more earth friendly, so I am trying this shampoo and conditioner. I only wash my hair once a week because I don't have alot of natural oil in my skin and scalp. Most shampoo and conditioners I use leave my hair unmanageable. I am hoping this one is different. It felt different using it, meaning the lather was thicker and the conditioner more easily spread over my hair. So as for now, I give it three stars. I will be back after a second or third use to amend my review if necessary."

"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",5 / 5,"The smell of this shampoo is incredible! The apple fragrance is spot on. Its bottle claims that it ""removes dulling residue"", as a detox shampoo should, and it definitely delivers.

I will say it does smell really good although the smell doesn't last as much after the shower. I also don't like how it is a clean product yet it comes in a plastic bottle so maybe the packaging could be changed. I have short hair so to me the bottle lasts quite a bit.

Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,2 / 5,"This purple shampoo did not hold up to the Joico quality that I am used to seeing when using their products. I love the Joice K-Pak conditioner because you can see instant results in your hair, but not the case for the Purple shampoo. I feel like I wasted a lot of product and received no results: instantly or over time. I currently have very light bleached blonde hair with extensions, and while the shampoo did give a tint to the extensions, it did nothing for my natural hair sadly. I have also used the Blue shampoo which worked a little better when I had darker blonde highlights, but the purple for lighter blondes is a no-go."
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best purple shampoo out of all the tried! Makes even virgin hair so ashy. Love how deep purple the shampoo actually is. Good amount for the amount you buy.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"This purple shampoo made my hair hold the blonde better than any other! Never seemed to damage my hair when using Atleast 1 times a week. My hair stayed strong, smelled great and all in all I have zero complaints."
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,4 / 5,I’m a huge Joico fan and I review this brand a lot. They have products in their line to target any hair needs that you have. I have bleached blonde hair which is definitely not forgiving of any damage. My natural color is a light blonde so the lift wasn’t too extreme. It does however get that brassy tone after the color process which is typical. This is the strong Barney purple that I use right after color processing. One use makes a huge and noticeable difference right away. I only leave it on for 5 minutes tops or else the purple will stick to hair. It’s not good when you think you’ve done a good job of rinsing only to find some random purple after you’ve dried your hair. Depending on the condition of your hair you definitely don’t ever need to leave it on for more than five minutes and twice a week tops. It’s not usually necessary. It has an average scent so that’s not a selling point. This shampoo has really one pain purpose in my opinion so I don’t see it as adding any shine or softening benefits. I do recommend this only if your hair is what it’s targeted to.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"The only purple shampoo that I trust to use on my hair! Tones brassiness and leaves your hair looking and feeling fabulous! 10/10 from me, great product"

As someone who is a natural brunette dying my hair blonde has been a struggle. I have always struggled with maintaining the cool, ashy tones and avoiding the dreaded brassy hues that can develop over time. That's why I was excited to try the Matrix Blue Brass Off Shampoo, which is specifically formulated to neutralize those unwanted warm tones and restore a beautiful, vibrant color. First and foremost, I was impressed with how effective this shampoo was at toning down the brassiness in my hair. After just one use, I noticed a significant difference in the color of my hair. The shampoo's blue pigments work to counteract the orange and yellow tones, leaving my hair looking much cooler and more natural. Not only does this shampoo deliver on its promise to eliminate brassiness, but it also leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft and smooth. The formula is gentle and nourishing, so it doesn't strip my hair of its natural oils or leave it feeling dry or brittle. Instead, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy, with a beautiful shine. I also appreciate the convenience of the packaging.

A little goes a long way with this shampoo, so the bottle lasts a long time, making it a great value for the price."

Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,5 / 5,This is my very favorite purple shampoo. I have yet to find another blonde shampoo that works as well as this on brassy highlights... and I have tried a ton of other products. There are two downsides. 1) this can turn your hair purple. Just follow the directions for how long to leave it on and rotate with your favorite non-purple shampoo. 2) This will stain your shower!!! The only thing I have found to get it off is called Bar Keepers Friend. Invest in some of that and you will be fine.
Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,1 / 5,"I wanted to like this product so bad, but it didn't work on my hair. I've noticed no differences after using this product twice now."

Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,5 / 5,I LOVED this stuff! i have brunette hair with a caramel balayage and using this three times alone already helped with the brassy orange tones present. Not to mention the smell and feel of this shampoo will have you feeling like you’re at the spa! Only thing to be careful of is that there is a heavy blue dye so use gloves :)

Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,4 / 5,"The shampoo, conditioner, and spray work together to help get rid of brassiness in brunette hair color. I have seen stuff for blonds but this is the first time I’ve seen something for brunettes. The only drawback is the color is quite blue so be sure to watch where you wash your hair and clean up after yourself when your done. This does a great job of taking the brass tones out of your hair especially for those of us who have hard water."
Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,5 / 5,This product was great as gave me the ashy look I needed on my blonde hair. It was a bit drying but most purple shampoos are.

Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo is perfect for keeping my ombre looking non-brassy and salon fresh. It could leave your hair a little purple if you don’t wash it out well enough. It’s also not as hydrating however paired with the condition and they are the perfect combo! This isn’t a miracle overnight, but you can see the difference it makes on the first wash. It was after wash #3 that my brassy hair was about 90% gone."
Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo,3 / 5,"Along with the conditioner this smells great and made my hair feel great. However, I did not notice a great difference in the tone of my hair."

L'Oreal Paris Brass Toning Purple Sulfate Free Shampoo,5 / 5,"I had never tried this shampoo/conditioner set before but in looking for purple one--those made specifically for blonde, silver and gray hair--I ran across this and decided to try it. My (now-white) hair has always been dry but even though I do not blow dry it I still feel it is on the dry side. It has also gotten a bit frizzy. This doesn't leave my hair as soft as I would like but I think it does a pretty fine job, hence four stars for moisturizing and softness. I do tend to rinse thoroughly so perhaps I am doing a bit too much. The scent is minimal, thank goodness, because I loathe scented/perfumed products of any kind. And my hair gets and looks wonderfully clean. Recommended."

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"I received Olaplex Bond Maintenance No.4 Shampoo gifted by Olaplex from Skeeper in exchange for an honest review, and I just had to share my thoughts with you. I have long, straight hair that tends to get frizzy because of dryness and an oily scalp. So, taking care of my hair is one of my favorite routines. I had heard many good things about Olaplex and was excited to try it. I loved it! When I rinsed the shampoo, my hair felt so smooth and soft. It added a beautiful shine to my hair and reduced the frizz significantly. My hair looked and felt much healthier, and it smelled amazing, too! It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth the money, especially for my long, thick hair. I'm a big fan of Olaplex shampoo and will add it to my hair care collection."

Tranquilamente 4 días sin lavarme el pelo y sin apariencia de suciedad. Cunde lo que cuesta porque yo solo compro dos champús al año, con poca cantidad llegas a todo el cuero cabelludo"

Faire quand même un bon soin hydratant juste après."
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,4 / 5,I wants to loved this but didn’t find a good benefit towards my hair- product was thick lathered nicely but ultimately seemed to dry my hair out much more than other products. I didn’t find the results to make me happy or something I’ll be purchasing often
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,doesn’t leave any product stuck on my hair and makes my hair so soft! it has really helped my hair since I dye it occasionally and is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have found
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo may seem pricey, but you honestly get way more out of it than typical shampoo. My hair is just above hip length, and I only use a quarter sized amount because it lathers up so well! My hair only has a small section that’s been bleached so it’s not super damaged, but I do think it really helps smooth the bleached parts whenever it’s starting to look a little dry and frazzled! I use this shampoo every other wash and use a clarifying shampoo in between. If you have flawless hair this shampoo isn’t going to do anything for you, but it’s great if you have any damage! I also really like the scent of this product. It’s light and smells clean. The packaging is nice and simple and the texture of the shampoo is creamy smooth."

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"OLAPLEX No 4 Bond Maintenance 100ml shampoo is an excellent choice for colored and bleached hair. It effectively cleanses the roots without drying out the length and is economical to use. A major plus is its good lather, making the hair care process more enjoyable. I recommend it for those seeking quality hair care after coloring and bleaching. The packaging is convenient and sturdy, yet easy to squeeze for product dosing. The cost corresponds to its quality, as this volume lasts for several months when using the shampoo 3-4 times a week. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, creating an enjoyable experience without overwhelming other smells. Shampoo boasts a luxurious texture that glides smoothly onto the hair, providing a rich lather for a thorough cleanse. Despite its rich consistency, it rinses off easily, leaving the hair feeling refreshed and revitalized."
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"As someone who has struggled with dry, damaged hair for years, discovering Olaplex No.4 Shampoo has been nothing short of a game-changer. From the first wash, I could feel the difference in my hair texture, and after consistent use, the results have been truly remarkable. First and foremost, let's talk about the formula. Olaplex's patented Bond Building technology sets it apart from any other shampoo on the market. This revolutionary formula not only cleanses the hair but also repairs and strengthens each strand from within. My hair feels noticeably healthier, smoother, and more resilient after just a few uses. Another standout feature is its ability to protect color-treated hair. As someone who regularly dyes their hair, finding a shampoo that preserves color while simultaneously nourishing and repairing is like hitting the jackpot. With Olaplex No.4, my color looks vibrant and lasts longer than ever before. Furthermore, the shampoo lathers beautifully, providing a luxurious and indulgent shower experience. Despite its powerful reparative properties, it doesn't weigh my hair down or leave any residue. Instead, it leaves my locks feeling clean, soft, and incredibly manageable. I also appreciate that it's free from sulfates, parabens, and other harsh chemicals, making it suitable for all hair types, including those with sensitive scalps. Knowing that I'm using a product that prioritizes the health and integrity of my hair gives me peace of mind. In terms of scent, Olaplex No.4 has a subtle and pleasant fragrance that lingers throughout the day without being overpowering. It's the perfect balance of freshness and sophistication. In conclusion, Olaplex No.4 Shampoo has exceeded all my expectations and has become an essential part of my hair care routine.

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"I was gifted this by Olaplex in exchange for an honest review. I have long, wavy hair and it has recently started to become dry. It’s slightly damaged from coloring, as well. I received this, and after the first wash my hair felt lighter and more smooth. Instantly it made my hair feel revitalized! I’ve used it a handful of times since receiving this, and there is a noticeable difference in my hair’s quality. My husband even noticed, saying it looks more healthy. I have the conditioner as well, and though they are a bit pricey, you are getting salon quality product with these. And it smells amazing! Highly recommend!"
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,1 / 5,"The shampoo smells nice and creates a thick rich lather. But unfortunately for me it caused my scalp to become flaky and feel itchy.

So I would try a sample before investing into this shampoo and do a little research."

After using it, my hair feels incredibly silky, and I can’t resist running my fingers through it. The scent is delightfully light, which I appreciate. One of the best features is that it’s sulfate-free, which is perfect for my bright red hair as it doesn’t strip away the color. I’ve also noticed a significant improvement in my hair’s overall condition. It effectively eliminates frizz and dryness, leaving my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It’s a top-notch shampoo!"

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,3 / 5,"I feel like this product does not clean at all. I also think it is too thick and leaves my hair greasy, not clean at all. I do think it strengthen my hair a little bit, but I also want my shampoos to clean my hair. I also think it is too expensive for what it does."

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo and conditioner is okay, I purchased it from the salon awhile back. I've seen lots of people talk about this shampoo and some say good things and some negative, but it's all on how it's used.. its not meant to be used as an every day shampoo. But everyone's hair type is different and some people could probably get away with using it every day or at every hair washing day, and for some it might be to harsh it all just depends. For me personally I've never experienced any negative things about this shampoo. The only thing is that it doesn't lather very much and I've tried massaging it in my palms first before massaging it onto my scalp and hair. If you use it correctly and what's it meant for it can be a great product to have. The conditioner is like any other, nothing spectacular and keeps my ends moisturized enough"

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,3 / 5,"Visually, the hair is more shiny, dense. Seal is felt at the roots of the hair, and along the length. The protruding hair is smoothed along the length. But is it worth paying more? In my opinion, no. As such, I did not notice hair restoration. Perhaps my hair is not damaged enough, and on a long-term blond, the difference would be obvious. But for myself, it’s better to buy shampoo cheaper, if there is no difference, then why overpay?"
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo is decent but I don’t think I would repurchase. It lathers well and has a light floral scent, however I find that I need to wash my hair every ~2 days after washing with this. I prefer a stronger shampoo."

Jamaican Black Castor Oil Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar,3 / 5,"This product is unique. I had never used a shampoo bar before, so I was really curious and eager to try Shea Moisture African Black Soap Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar. I follow a co-wash regimen by which I only use a regular shampoo once a week, so I am down with alternative hair care products. The bar itself looks cool. It's black and sort of waxy feeling and it has a cool shape. It doesn't have much of a scent. Two of the edges are tapered so you can use those edges to rub on your scalp, then lather and rinse.&nbsp; [product:jamaican-black-castor-oil-bentonite-clay-shampoo-bar]"

Jamaican Black Castor Oil Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"[product:jamaican-black-castor-oil-bentonite-clay-shampoo-bar] ￼is one of my favorite things I’ve come across. I’m rating this product 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because I love to use this as a shaving bar. I use it on my pits, legs and elsewhere to get a smooth, close and moisturized shave. 🪒 I did try this one time as a shampoo like it’s marketed and it left my hair feeling how you’d think a bar shampoo would feel. Dry and stripped. This may be a great eco friendly option for bathing while camping or backpacking or staying out in the woods for any reason and having to bathe. It does make it feel clean but a weird film on top of the hair. That’s not at all how this feels on the skin while shaving though. I’m not sure that this is something I’ll continue buying as a shave bar but it does last a while so if it’s on sale sometime at Ulta again then I may buy it again."
Jamaican Black Castor Oil Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar,2 / 5,"Was not really a fan of the shampoo bar, didn’t really feel like it cleaned my hair much! However I do have extensions in so this may be why it didn’t work so well for my hair may be better for someone with less hair"

Suave Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my FAVORITE dry shampoo when I can find it! I have coarse, curly hair - I also have a 9-month-old, so I don’t always have the time to give my hair the love it needs. This stuff is a lifesaver when my roots start getting oily but my ends can’t take a wash yet, and it takes less than two minutes to apply. My curls LOVE the keratin. And since Suave products always have that luxurious salon smell, just for those two minutes, I get to escape and pamper myself. 💆🏼‍♀️"

Suave Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my holy grail dry shampoo. I mean it. If you can get your hands on some of this, buy as many cans as possible, because its currently discontinued. It's extremely effective at absorbing oil while also making your hair soft. Doesnt weigh down hair or make it brittle. Can be used on freshly washed & dried hair to add volume that lasts. BUT THE SMELL, OH MY GOD. IT SMELLS INCREDIBLE. Every single time that I've ever used it in front of other people--especially men--they've made a comment about how good it smells. Ive even used it just to scent my hair when I wasn't oily at all. All the other Suave dry shampoos are just average but this specific one, the Keratin Infusion in a gold can with an orange label, is intoxicating."

Suave® Naturals Tropical Coconut Shampoo,4 / 5,"I can't stand the taste of coconut. It's stringy and weird and I've never found it appealing. That said, I love the smell of artificial coconut. Absolutely cannot get enough of it. When it came time then to buy some new shampoo, wouldn't you know, I bought the coconut smell because that's what I like. The shampoo seemingly works (I haven't developed any odd rashes, noticed my hair to be any more dry/oily or any other real changes) and I think Suave did a nice job with making the coconut smell sweet but not overbearing. Seeing as how I really like the scent, I'd probably continue to buy it again and again and again. I like it"

Pureology Strength Cure Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love love love purology and this product is amazing. I have long blonde/ strawberry hair and this leaves my hair clean but not too dehydrated. This is the only shampoo that really has a perfect lather to it , it allows you to make a little product go a long way. Purology is a luxury for me, the price is definitely on the higher side but in my opinion the quality justifies the cost. I have also tried the hydrate line which is also amazing but sometimes I have troubles with my hair getting oily faster when using that product. It smells amazing, different than this product but this also has a great scent.This is my first bottle but I will definitely repurchase."

Since using this shampoo, I've noticed a significant reduction in breakage and split ends, and my hair feels noticeably stronger and more resilient.

Pureology Strength Cure Shampoo,5 / 5,Love this! Been using it for years. It is expensive! But I bleach my hair mostly so I can't really gripe about having to spend extra on good hair products. Scent is super nice. You can smell it for days! I would recommend making sure you really really wash out all of the conditioner before you finish because it will give you a greasy head. And also blow dry most of your hair after. If not it gets waxy feeling and oily looking. But I guarantee you if you use it they way I do it will blow your mind. I have literal bleach blonde barbie hair all over and it looks do healthy and perfect that it could almost pass as a wig. Lol and of course that means a good hairstylist as well but after years of bleaching I know the only way to keep it looking salon fresh is with this shampoo and conditioner. I won't change it!
Pureology Strength Cure Shampoo,5 / 5,One of my most favorite shampoos for when I used to dye it blonde it used to being it back to life!

Scent: The scent is delightful, with a fresh and fruity fragrance that lingers pleasantly in my hair. It's not overpowering, and it doesn't irritate my scalp.

Effectiveness: This conditioner does an incredible job of defining and hydrating my curls. It helps to reduce frizz and adds volume without leaving my hair feeling greasy. My curls look healthier, bouncier, and more defined than ever before. Value for Money: Considering the price and the effectiveness of this conditioner, I believe it offers excellent value for money. A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts quite a while. Hair Texture: I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz easily. This conditioner has helped to transform my waves into beautiful, defined curls. It's suitable for a variety of curl types, from loose waves to tight coils.

Pantene Curl Perfection Shampoo,5 / 5,"Di questa linea di sono piaciuti molto alcuni prodotti, altri meno. Lo shampoo lo trovo troppo corposo e pesante sul mio capello fine, dopo l'applicazione il capello è risultato un pò pesante. Ottimo il balsamo, che districa benissimo, lascia il capello morbido e setoso, e da subito ripara e ammorbidisce le punte. Lo ricomprerò. La maschera non mi ha dato il risultato sperato, l'ho tenuta in posa 2 minuti come indicato, e sì, è molto ristrutturate, ma non ho visto una grande differenza sulla tenuta del riccio. Il prodotto, dal mio punto di vista, top gamma di questa linea è indubbiamente la crema nutriente senza risciacquo. È ottima perchè non appesantisce, definisce e modella il riccio rendendolo luminoso e durevole; e anche applicata tra un lavaggio e l'altro, da capello asciutto, per ridefinire soprattuto le punte e proteggerle dal crespo, è davvero ottima. E ne bastano piccolissime quantità. Flacone riciclabile"

L'Oréal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,I recently bought a few Extraordinary Oil shampoos and conditioners as I had run out. I have used this shampoo and conditioner regularly over several years with great results. However the new batch bought in December 2023 is very disappointing. My hair feels very greasy and after a day my head feels unclean and slightly scratchy. I know that the recipe ie oils used have changed as the feel and fragrance has changed. I hope someone from the company reads this and contact me.
L'Oréal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,Ho preso questo shampoo per capelli lunghi che dovrebbe rafforzare il capello evitando rotture e doppie punte. Mi fido di questa marca che conosco da anni e trovo sempre in offerta. Super prodotto. @influenster @voxbox

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,3 / 5,"It does clean my oily roots well, but it leaves a feeling of dryness, and it also tangles my hair, will I'll take another shampoo like this, probably not. I like the smell, texture. That’s about it."
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"Oh, the Briogeo Scalp Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo is a game-changer for me! Since I’ve been dealing with a dry, sensitive scalp, finding a shampoo that can exfoliate without making things worse has been tough. This one hits the spot. The texture is like a gentle scrub for your scalp—really gets in there without being too harsh. You can feel the micro-exfoliation working as it clears away any buildup while leaving my scalp feeling soothed. Plus, the mix of charcoal and coconut oil? Genius. It balances things out so my scalp doesn’t feel stripped but still gets that deep clean. The coconut oil adds that touch of moisture, and you know how much I love anything that’s hydrating but not heavy. And the smell? Subtle and fresh, like a coconut spa moment at home. I use it once a week, especially after a hectic week where dry shampoo’s been doing most of the work. It’s a scalp detox, and it leaves my hair feeling light and refreshed. Perfect for taming my unmanageable waves!"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"The scrub it's not bad, it didn't fully meet my expectations. I found that it lacks larger exfoliating particles for a deeper cleanse. Additionally, the texture is quite runny, making it difficult to apply and spread evenly on the scalp—it tends to drip and doesn't stay in place. Overall, it's an okay product, but next time, I might look for something thicker and more effective."
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"LOVE this shampoo. I have very oily hair and after using this for over a year, my hair feels less greasy.

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,3 / 5,Does it actually help? I'm not so sure.... I think the idea is great and the product feels fresh and nice... but the amount of the exfoliant doesn't really reach much of your scalp. Some areas manage if you're hair isn't too thick
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"The Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo by Briogeo is designed to deeply cleanse the scalp and gently exfoliate the skin, promoting a healthy and buildup-free scalp. It features activated charcoal, coconut oil, and micro-exfoliating particles in its formulation. Key Ingredients Activated Charcoal: Helps attract and remove impurities, excess oil, and residue from the scalp. Coconut Oil: Provides essential nutrients and helps maintain moisture. Salicylic Acid: Exfoliates the scalp and helps prevent dead skin cell buildup. Peppermint Oil: Offers a refreshing sensation and may help stimulate circulation in the scalp. User Experience Texture and Application: The shampoo has a gel-like texture with small exfoliating particles that dissolve as you apply it. The formula spreads easily and creates a light foam.

The exfoliation is gentle, making it suitable for frequent use without causing irritation. Effectiveness Cleansing: The shampoo effectively cleanses the scalp, removing product residue and excess oil without leaving it feeling stripped or dry. Exfoliation: The exfoliating particles provide a soft yet effective exfoliation, removing dead skin cells and promoting a healthier scalp.

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"I get really bad dry scalp, so I am all about scalp scrubs! I received this Beiogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-exfoliating Scalp Scrub complimentary from Briogeo. This is such a cool scrub as it is also a shampoo. I suffer from dry, flaky scalp, so I’m always on the hunt for scalp products. 🥥 Briogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-exfoliating Scalp Scrub contains charcoal, coconut oil, tea-tree and mint oils. It’s so heavenly on my scalp! It starts out as a gentle exfoliator with dissolvable granules and when applied and massaged in, becomes a rich lather. It leaves my scalp and hair feeling so fresh and clean and works wonderfully with all my Briogeo hair masks. I’m a bit obsessed. 🥥"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"If you use as much dry shampoo as I do, or if you have a dry scalp, this is a must in your hair care routine! Opening the container you can smell the tea tree oil, peppermint and spearmint. I knew this was going to be a great shampoo/scalp scrub! The shampoo is easy to apply and work from scalp to ends. The lather is amazing! I wasn’t expecting to like this shampoo as much as I do. It removes buildup, oil and dirt and nourishes the scalp. Love this shampoo! This is good for all hair types and texture. It is a clean product that packs a punch! Will become an item in my hair care products! ✅ Clean + Planst Aware ✅Cruelty Free, ✅Vegan ✅Gluten Free"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"Briogeo has truly impressed me with this shampoo! As someone who values clean, natural, and effective beauty products, this shampoo ticks all the boxes. The micro-exfoliating formula is gentle, yet effective and helps to promote a healthier scalp! Briogeo products are all about clean beauty - they are vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free, which aligns perfectly with my values. l've noticed an improvement in the health of my scalp since incorporating this product into my routine! If you're looking for a natural and effective solution to detoxify and refresh your scalp, this is it!"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"I have started using this recently and noticed it cleanses the scalp really well. It leaves a cooling sensation on the scalp which feels good and refreshing. Although, it’s a bit on the pricey side but you only need to use it once a week as a mask."
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"So, while I don't have dandruff, my hair gets super greasy. I don't use a lot of hair products besides the normal shampoo and conditioner. Upon opening the tub, you get a strong whiff of a minty scent. It's not horrible but noticeable. I got my hair wet with cool water before applying the product. I used my scalp brush to massage it into my scalp. The first time, it didn't really lather up, but the second wash was a little better. I left the second wash on for a couple of minutes while I shaved, washed, etc. Then, I applied a moisturizing volume conditioner. I have to say my hair was noticeably softer once it dried. My hair didn't start looking greasy until day three. Normally, it's looking greasy the next day. I do have to say there needs to be an easier way to apply it. Having to scoop up the product can lead to a mess, and it's just a pain in general. I think I'll use this once a week for a hair reset!"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"Starting with the outcome, I do not think this worked in getting rid of dandruff. I had more success in using a clarifying shampoo in getting rid of my dandruff long term than with this product. The results I think I did get: I think this scrub helped as a short term solution in helping to remove dandruff (not the root cause) and exfoliate the scalp. My husband and I both used it, and I think the amount required for short hair was also much more manageable than the amount I felt was required for my long hair - even applying it just at the scalp. It takes a lot of product to really get it in there and scrub. I did think the scent was nice as well."
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"It smelled minty and your scalp feels fresh after using it. I like using it when I feel like I have a lot of product buildup from dry shampoo, heat protectant, etc."

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"I first got this as a sample and loved it so much I went ahead and bought the whole thing!

It lasts so long too, which makes up for the price."

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,3 / 5,"I didn’t read clearly when I got this and I expected it to be a more psychical scrub than it is.

The product is more fluid than a conditioner and really easy to work into the roots. The scent is really fresh. For me this was a product to use once every two weeks. The downside is the price tag, the initial outlay is quite steep but you don’t need to use a lot so a tub can last a few months"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,Depends on what you’re looking for. My brother uses this for regular dandruff and it works like a charm.

Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Smells great and left my hair feeling clean and silky. Half the time I buy shampoos, I feel like they are all the same ingredients, but use different labels, but shampoos like this prove me wrong. Pros- - Smells great - Thick, silky smooth texture feels great on hair - Didn't require much for a rich lather Cons- - Can't think of any!"
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel so clean and soft. After a blow dry the smell lingers and stays for a while. I’m love how my it conditions my split ends and prolongs salon visits for trims
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,4 / 5,"This works well on my oily scalp and dry strands. Cleans effectively without stripping the nutrients so can use daily. Hair feels soft and smooth after usage.

Affordable price."
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,3 / 5,"Den her shampoo er faktisk ret god. Mit hår er ret følsomt over for shampoo og normalt må jeg bruge de ret dyrere mærker, fordi mit hår er så stort og kraftigt. Men den her har overrasket mig, jeg bruger den sammen med den tilhørende balsam hver anden dag. Og topper med hårkuren hver 4. Dag. Mit hår er rent og blødt.. og så er det rart, at man altid kan finde det her brand på tilbud. Indpakningen, emballagen er fin men låget går nemt i stykker, hvilket er lidt irriterende, for shampoo kan ikke stå uden låg."
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this company, the smell is amazing and my hair is so shiny after I use it. The package is pretty and fits nicely next to the conditioner. The texture my hair has is silky smooth and it doesn’t get greasy overnight like other shampoos."

Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"J'ai récemment essayé le Shampooing Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10, et je suis absolument ravi des résultats. Ce produit a surpassé mes attentes à bien des égards. Tout d'abord, la formule est incroyablement nourrissante. Dès la première utilisation, j'ai remarqué une différence significative dans la texture de mes cheveux. Ils étaient plus doux, plus lisses et incroyablement faciles à coiffer. La formule Pro-V semble vraiment fonctionner en profondeur pour revitaliser les cheveux de l'intérieur, laissant une sensation de fraîcheur et de légèreté. Un autre point fort est l'odeur divine de ce shampooing. Le parfum est frais, subtil et dure longtemps sur les cheveux. C'est une expérience sensorielle agréable à chaque utilisation, et cela ajoute définitivement à l'ensemble de l'expérience du lavage des cheveux. Ce que j'apprécie particulièrement avec le Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10, c'est sa polyvalence. Comme son nom l'indique, il offre 10 bienfaits en un seul produit. Mes cheveux semblent plus forts, plus hydratés, et l'éclat naturel est accentué. Cela simplifie considérablement ma routine capillaire quotidienne.

Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I was a little skeptical about shampooing my starter locs in general but when I came across this product and product reviews I decided to give it a try. I loved it the tip of the bottle made it so easy to be able to penetrate my scalp, my hair smells amazing, & It was perfect to get the built up dirt, oils, and mostly edge control out of my hair. I will be continuing to use this product through my loc journey."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This is definitely a clarifying shampoo. It will get the dirt and debris out. Liquid to foam action is on point. It lasted me a while so it is well worth the money. It is also a really big bottle of shampoo. Has the light scent also. I do recommend. Already have a backup!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I really do like it, it does the job nicely. It’s a bit drying but it’s recommended that you use a deep conditioning afterward and the problem is gone. Does not dry the hair at the end of the routine and has a really nice scent to it."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! A little goes a long way! It doesn’t make my hair feel stripped and dried out! It leaves my hair soft and moisturized! And my curls always look amazing after I use this shampoo ! Definitely recommend if u have curly hair!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"Ce shampooing clarifiant est très efficace, le flacon à bec permet de faire pénétrer le shampooing là où vous en avez besoin et il mousse bien. Ce shampooing est très décapant, il est donc préférable de l'utiliser une fois par mois ou deux fois si nécessaire."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I love this stuff! I use it on my wash days and I kept it in my routine! It smells delicious. Doesn’t matter what scent you get, this gives you the clean that you’re looking for. I suggest you try it."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,I use this shampoo on my Sisterlocks and does a great job at getting them clean. I love the nozzle on the bottle which is great for easy application. The price point is not bad on the pockets.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I love this shampoo! However after using it my hair does feel really dry, but that’s because it really clarifies my scalp and gets rid of any build up. It lathers really nicely and smells absolutely incredible."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I consistently struggle to find shampoo that works for my hair. I picked this up about a month ago to try something new and I will never use another shampoo. It works great! For me, it works a little like a clarifying shampoo but doesn’t completely strip my hair. The aloe really helps protect and keep a bit of moisture. There is a light fragrance to the shampoo, but it’s not heavy and overpowering. Note to others: This shampoo is the consistency of water and doesn’t really lather. There is a pointed tip to help get a more even application over your scalp and hair. I also use a scalp massager to help work it into my scalp and roots. I rinse with cool water and follow up with my favorite conditioner."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,3 / 5,"It's not bad, but it definitely seems like more of a clarifying shampoo. It cleaned my hair really well, but unfortunately left it feeling stripped and kind of dry. This is not a shampoo I would use everyday, maybe more like once a week just to get rid of product build up. The scent is very strong and stays in your hair."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This is the product I didn't know I needed. Simply, this is a clarifying shampoo with a targeted applicator to make sure you get this on the scalp. It layers up quickly and removes build up from the scalp. I would not recommend using this for a double wash because it will make your scalp and hair so dry! Use this, then use your usual shampoo to do the second wash, do your regular conditioning routine and you won't regret it! This leaves my oily scalp SO clean and does a much better job than a double wash with even the best shampoos. If you have issues with build up, oily scalp, dandruff, etc, you need this. I have seborrheic dermatitis and this clears it up and extends my time between washes. By the way, I have fine and straight hair and I use this once a week or every other week."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,3 / 5,"This shampoo made my hair feels squeaky and dry, which contributed to frizzy hair once it dried. I would not recommend this product to those with 3b curls like mine."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I have a hard time finding products for fine curly hair but this is perfect!! Weightless, cleans really well, helps my curls!!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"After getting a keratin treatment and dying my hair my 3A curls turned more wavy and it’s been tough getting them to curl again. I have thin, low porosity, 3A hair, and had a lot of product build up and damage after keratin and using dye; I tried other clarifying shampoos and they weren’t as good as this one I feel like this felt like it really removed everything from my hair and makes me feel like I’m starting fresh. If you don’t have that much product build up it it might be too stripping and dry it out so if you do get this make sure to use it once a month or around there to ensure you’re not drying out your hair. For my people who build up product in their hair easily this is going to be great every couple week or month to get the build up out! Especially us with low porosity."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I have very long, curly hair and this is one of my favorite shampoos to use. The scent is great and the product keeps my hair soft and manageable while keeping my curls hydrated. I love this brand and their products!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,3 / 5,"I have very wavy hair and had never tried a water to foam shampoo before. But this did not lather as much as I’d like, and didn’t leave my hair feeling washed."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,Absolutely love and cannot go a day without it. It has become part of my routine and always makes me feel brand new and HEALTHY!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I found Carol's Daughter haircare line during COV19 at Dollar General and Walmart. I tried both scents of cowash, a rose scent and then this one, aloe vera scent. I was searching for a product to remove buildup from my scalp and help with dullness I was experiencing from a very expensive haircare line. These formulas for shampoo are EXCELLENT for under $12.00 I did not necessarily use because of curly hair, these both work well on curly wavy or straight hair, as my daughter also used for over a month. I prefer the Rose scent and results. Although both are a clear light water then transform to a foam as you circle into your scalp. These products remove all build up and leave your hair so light feeling you will definitely immediately notice a difference with the first wash. My shine was restored after first use. My hair feels so soft, not weighed down at all, and so healthy. I only need to wash with this product once per week. These two items have helped my overall hair growth goals immensely. I would definetly recommend these two cowash items and add them to your rotation of haircare products. I have finished 4 bottles after several months and I am so impressed with the quality, results, at a budget price. [product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-with-rose-water] [product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-for-curly-hair]"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This product has been amazing for the overall texture of my hair. Since using this product, my hair has become much softer and healthier. I love the application tip and how well it rids the scalp of build up. I have psoriasis that affects the scalp and this product is extremely soothing. It also doesn’t contain a slew of chemicals and is affordable."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"So first off- my hair isn't really curly. It's thick, wavy, and color treated. I loved the applicator tip because I could get the wash to where I needed it easily. I only opened it part way so it wouldn't come out too fast. In the shower, it was pretty drying. To the extent that if you have dry hair, I don't think I'd recommend it. It feels like a clarifying shampoo. It has a strong citrus scent, which was pleasant, but if you're sensitive to citrus oils it could be problematic. HOWEVER my hair came right back to life after conditioner (I just used cheap garnier fructis tbh). When my hair dried it felt so clean and soft, honestly better than I've had it with most other shampoos (I feel like with other shampoo I'm always left with oily or waxy residue). Also, it didn't seem to take very much color out of my hair (a big plus in my book)."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"C A R O L .. Come her and Bring your DAUGHTER ! Not only is this shampoo easy to administer directly to your scalp , it’s Water to Sud formulation is PERFECT! I love the light Aloe smell & how it leaves your hair feeling Clean but not brittle !"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,1 / 5,I have thick 4c hair that’s about ear to neck length when stretched and major shrinkage when dry. I tried to edit my original review via the app but the app wasn’t letting me. So I will be posting a new review. I bought this again for the 2nd time since it’s worked for me before. This time around my hair does not seem to like it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or if since I’ve been getting my hair professionally taken care my hair has changed. Either way every time I use it now my hair is like straw. There’s no more slip and if not delicate easily can tear and break my strands. It’s unfortunate. This time around I bought the set that comes with the conditioner. Tbh the conditioner is the only saving grace it brings the slip back after the shampoo dried my hair out. I won’t be using this again and will be trying other things that could work.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,2 / 5,I wash my hair in twists to minimize the tangles. The pointed nozzle is perfect to get product straight onto my scalp. On the downside. This is marketed as a clarifying shampoo and it did no such this.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo, males my hair feel clean and not stripped or dry. I’m currently on my second bottle and will continue to buy this, it’s so affordable."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"Although it recommended for braids, I love the feel and smell of this shampoo now that it's Summer time to get rid of sweat and grime off my scalp and short hair!! Love it has moisturizing aloe and that it suds well without stripping my scalp!! Definitely buy again at my local Target for the Summer months!!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I started using this shampoo a few weeks ago and it has been AMAZING! My hair feels clean and softer than ever. The bottle makes washing my hair way easier. The smell is different (not bad, but wasn't what you normally expect from a shampoo). However, the scent has grown on me. The best I can do to explain it is kinda limey? Overall, this is a great shampoo and I will be switching it to a staple in my constant routine."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"REVIEW EDIT: I wanted to add this important item to my review... If you're out in the sun a lot, this will lightly bleach your hair because of the lemonene in it. My hair has gone from dark brown to a nice honey brown with highlights! I really like how this smells. It has a nice, refreshing lemon smell that gives my senses a wakeup call the mornings that I use it. This delightful hair wash has a more watery feel to it that you use the nozzle to squirt through your scalp, I feel like this way it's really getting to the root of my oil issue. After it's on it lathers well, better than I would imagine with how watery it looks. The only issue I have with this is that I feel like I'm having to wash my hair more when I use this one because my scalp gets oily every other day that I use it, some of the other shampoos I've used last at least 3 days and I can't get this one to do that without using baby powder. The good thing is even though I have to use this more it still lasts a long time, I've been using it for a month and have not run out yet so it's definitely a value for the money. I just don't like having to use it more often than other shampoos on the market."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo has been a lifesaver for my curls. It smells so fresh and clean and makes my hair feel good even though there isn’t much lather!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This stuff is amazing!! Cleans hair thoroughly without drying it out. Smells wonderful...crisp clean scent paired with the gel to cream conditioner your hair is left feeling soft moisturized and detangled. Works great on my hair 3c and my childrens coily hair as well 4c. I love this product line. Wanting to try the rosewater scent as well. Love this stuff!!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,The applicator on this bottle is perfect! I have very thick hair and every time I use this I really feel like ALL my hair and scalp gets cleaned. The scent is nice. It rinses well. But my hair gets a bit oily if I use this every wash. The price point is good! So I do recommend it!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,As you know this product is very good it has olive oil and my honest opinion and makes your skin small soft and feels very clean in your hair I use it every 3 days and it makes my hair feel very healthy I just wish the bottle was a little bigger but it was satisfying to my opinion [product:carol's-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-for-curly-hair]
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,its okay! i feel like its so watery so i end up using more than i want to. it smells so good & leaves my hair feeling clean. i use it when im not planning on doing my whole hair care routine & it still leaves my hair curly
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,1 / 5,"I’ve gone through nearly the entire bottle (washing every few days) so I’ve really given it a chance, IMO. The smell is nice and it feels quite silky to the touch but I absolutely hate how my hair feels when using it. I can’t even run my fingers through it to spread it to the rest of my hair. It does a good job removing oils for the most part and once I use the conditioner it does make my hair feel super silky and soft but I’ve started using other shampoos to really get the job done."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,I use this product in winter or when I've skipped shampooing for a little too long. I normally wait 5 plus days to shampoo my hair. If I feel like I have buildup or a dry scalp this product cures all. I have dry curly hair so I always follow with a deep conditioner. Leaves me feeling clean but not stripped.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,2 / 5,"I was so excited about this product! I love the idea of the liquid consistency and the easy to apply nozzle. I also liked the addition of salicylic acid in the ingredients for exfoliating the scalp skin. However, this product just did not work for me. It does lather well, but as soon as I start to shampoo my hair with this, my hair feels so dry. It makes it so much more difficult to detangle after I wash. I’ve tried to love this product and used it multiple times, but i’d rather use my other clarifying shampoos that leave my hair feeling clean, but not straw-like and dry.￼"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This is my new favorite shampoo, not too many chemicals, #BlackOwned #BlackCompany would definitely recommend to try it!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I liked that this shampoo was clarifying, but when used every wash day, it felt stripping. For those who have oily scalps, this would work well to get rid of any excess oil. The scent can be strong to those with sensitive noses. I would repurchase to use once a week!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,First I want to start by saying I love how you apply this. The nozzle is great to get the product to your scalp. It smells great and leaves my roots and scalp feeling clean but not dry and stripped. Definitely considering to buy again or try another product by this brand.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I have an oily scalp/roots and dry blonde bleached hair,it is so hard to find the shampoo that would clean my oily roots without over-drying the ends.I saw a dermatologist dr.Dray was using it and decided to try.I bought it at Ulta and I have to say I really like it! It is a very light water to foam consistency,it cleans my scalp really well and does not over-dry my ends. Love the fresh scent as well. Need to try the conditioner too."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,I have never used a water to foam shampoo before so this was a new experience. It didn't lather too well. (Or atleast enough to notice) but I am impressed. My hair is majorly damaged and I think I finally found a shampoo that works for me and my hair:)
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This product is amazing! I love the nozzle on this bottle which is why I wanted to purchase it in the first place. It’s now finally available in Canada (the conditioner too)
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"So happy I found this product! I have 2b waves and a dry scalp from autoimmune issues, and this product is great for me. It lathers beautifully, cuts through oil treatments, and helps with my dry scalp. I’m on bottle 3, I love it!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,1 / 5,"Although this shampoo did a great job cleaning my hair, it also left it dry, feeling stripped and frizzy. FRAGRANCE is the 4th ingredient in this product, which is bad if you have sensitive skin. Usually fragrance is listed at the bottom of the ingredients list on a shampoo bottle, not the very top (indicating alot of it was used in this bottle). Ironically, aloe is mentioned on the front of the bottle, and yet aloe is listed at the very bottom of the ingredients list. The strong odor of the parfum/fragrance was a little too much for me. I did like the applicator on the bottle and you get alot of product for your money. However, this wasn't for me!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This is great for stepping out all the residue from my mouse and gel. Lathers up really nice. Tricky to get used to applying since it's really liquid, but it's great for clarifying"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This is one of my go-tos! It makes wash day so easy because it comes in a bottle with an applicator tip to make sure you don’t miss any areas! The lather is amazing and the smell is really clean. This shampoo doesn’t dry my hair out at all but it leaves my scalp feeling super clean and it also helps define my curls! I LOVE it & will keep buying it for as long as they keep making it lol 😂🙌🏾
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,the smell is amazing and it definitely feels like it’s getting all the dirty out of ur hair without leaving it dry. I love it. I feel like like it may take a while to get foamy sometimes but I honestly love it.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,I started watering down my shampoos and switching my shampoo bottle’s lid with this application nozzle before it was even cool! It allows you to directly apply the shampoo to your scalp without drying out the rest of your hair. I recommend! But you need extra conditioning after using this shampoo in my opinion
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,It is so easy it’s kind of like water when it comes out but it is very soap once you start to use it￼. Elaborate in the hair and it is absolutely amazing
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I like this shampoo on a day I want a deep clean. It leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean, literally, which for me means that’s it’s probably slightly stripped of moisture now. Otherwise, I love the liquid to foam aspect and the scent is pleasant."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I’m a HUGE fan of this shampoo!! Having locs, the most important thing to wash is the scalp & let the studs trickle down the hair. This nozzle on the shampoo bottle lets me get the product directly on my scalp, creates a nice lather & leaves my hair clean & smelling great!"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,"I didn't like this. It didn't do much for my curly hair. I wasn't expecting it to weigh my hair down and make it appear flat. I have curly hair, and it's bouncy. This only hurt my hair. Value? Not worth it for me"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Loved this shampoo and conditioner duo !! It made my hair feel soft and moisturised, as well as making my hair look shiny ✨ the scent lasts all day and smells amazing. Would recommend buying this for the value and the aesthetic packaging."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,Obsessed with the smell and its get the job done at an affordable price. I have wavy hair texture and it helps hydrate my curls. Love the color of the bottle!
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"OGX Argan Oil Shampoo is great! It has a lovely, rich smell and makes my hair feel soft and shiny. It’s gentle on the scalp and helps with frizz, leaving my hair looking smooth and healthy. Plus, a little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. Highly recommend!"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Ich benutze dieses Produkt seit mehr als einem Monat und die Zusammensetzung passt perfekt zu mir. Nach dem Waschen werden die Haare für lange Zeit glänzend, krümelig und sauber. Der Duft ist sehr angenehm. Ich kann es auf jeden Fall empfehlen und werde es selbst weiterhin verwenden."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"The OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo is a game-changer for dry hair! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and nourished, and the luxurious scent lingers all day. The packaging is sleek and easy to use, plus the argan oil ingredients feel super high quality. For the results, it’s definitely good value for money, though it could be a bit more moisturizing for extra-dry hair."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,I have been using this for a while now and it’s a great everyday shampoo. The smell is really good and for the price it doesn’t break the bank! I like the way it leaves my hair feeling clean.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,1 / 5,Terrible product that breaks hair and causes extreme hairfall. The packaging and scent is fine but the product ingredients are harmful and cause breakage
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Hello everyone!the texture of the shampoo is thick and creamy.Foams and washes off very well,washes the hair super👍the scent is light,unobtrusive 🩵 The packaging is concise .effectiveness and value 👍"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Made my hair feel very thick, soft, and smells great. I was able to get a lot for the price. The bottle size and shape makes it easy to pack for travel."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,The product does hydrate and leave your hair feeling soft but it does take a lot more product I feel to achieve the results. The fragrance that is used is not overwhelming it’s very light and overall a nice inexpensive product.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,I adore this product so much for what you get in the package it’s just amazing it helped when I had long hair it detangeled my hair and gave it life and texture and for the price uuuu and I love the smell it has I still use it till this day
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Great product, lathers very well. I've been using it for years and love it. The scent is very nice, not too strong or overwhelming. Packaging is cute, and the product lasts a long time due to the amount of lather, so definitely worth the money."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,Honestly did not love it. It just didn’t work with my hair at all. Made my hair feel gummy and full of products. I feel it did less repair and more just coating the hair to make you believe. The bottle/packaging was nice and sturdy and didn’t break upon dropping it a few times in the shower. It smelt nice but all together I wouldn’t buy again. I’ve had cheaper that felt better
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"All of the ogx shampoos are good, but this one is my favorite. It’s smells good and my hair is so soft and shiny afterwards. I use it with the matching shampoo."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"As someone who’s always on the lookout for the perfect shampoo, I decided to try the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo, and it has truly been a game-changer for my hair care routine. Here’s my detailed experience with this product. The first thing that struck me about the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo was its enticing, luxurious scent. The fragrance is light yet indulgent, making my hair-washing experience feel like a spa day. The shampoo contains argan oil, a revered ingredient known for its moisturizing and repairing properties. Argan oil is rich in vitamin E and antioxidants, which help restore and strengthen hair. The texture of the shampoo is creamy and rich, which feels great when applying it to my hair. A little goes a long way, and it lathers up nicely without being overly foamy. It spreads easily, ensuring that every strand gets coated with the nourishing formula. Despite its richness, it rinses out cleanly, leaving no residue behind. From the very first wash, I noticed a significant difference in the feel of my hair. It was softer, smoother, and more manageable. Over time, the benefits only increased. My hair, which is usually prone to frizz and dryness, became noticeably shinier and healthier. The argan oil really seems to penetrate the hair shaft, providing deep conditioning and improving overall hair health. One of the standout features of this shampoo is its ability to tame frizz. Living in a humid environment, frizz has always been a major concern for me, but the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo has made a considerable difference. My hair is now much easier to style and maintain throughout the day. I also appreciate that OGX products are sulfate-free, which means they are gentler on the hair and scalp. This shampoo does not strip the hair of its natural oils, which is crucial for maintaining hair health. Additionally, the product is paraben-free, which aligns with my preference for more natural and less chemically-laden hair care products. Reading other reviews, I found that many users share my positive experience. People with various hair types, from curly to straight, seem to benefit from this shampoo. The common thread among reviews is the noticeable improvement in hair texture and health. However, as with any product, individual results may vary. Some users with extremely fine hair noted that it can be a bit heavy, so it might be worth considering if you have a similar hair type. Overall, the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo has become a staple in my hair care routine. Its rich, nourishing formula and delightful scent make it a pleasure to use. The improvement in my hair’s texture, shine, and manageability has been remarkable. I would highly recommend this shampoo to anyone looking to enhance their hair’s health and appearance, especially if you struggle with dryness and frizz like I do. As always, it’s a good idea to try a new product and see how it works for your specific hair type and needs. In conclusion, the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo has exceeded my expectations, and I look forward to continued use for even better results."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,smells sooooooo good. absolutely love the smell. hesitant to use after learning it has ingredients that lead to hair loss. but the strength of the smell aligns with shampoos that are much more expensive. honestly would recommend if ur just looking for a basic good smelling shampoo without hair concerns
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,Really do like this shampoo and conditioner and doesn’t have any bad stuff in to strip your hair. Smells amazing and the shampoo makes your hair feel really clean and doesn’t make it go greasy.

OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"This has a lovely scent to it, is effective and decent value for money. However, there are some fairly harmful ingredients in it. The packaging is okay and typical for OGX, nice and easy to open."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"This makes my hair feel amazing! After baby bleaching my hair so much, it has really been amazing at repairing my hair. It also smells amazing!!!"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"The shampoo smells good, hair becomes silky and smooth nice and easy to comb fluffy and tender. Good and high quality, I recommend it to everyone"

It makes my hair so sleek and silky. Its a great shampoo and super affordable. Love this brand and tbh any shampoo from them is great.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,Wasn’t a huge fan of how this made my hair feel and look. It just didnt feel as effective as other hair brands. I also heard that the ingredients aren’t actually good for you either
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,Not bad for a drugstore brand but causes buildup on your scalp and can leave your hair greasy. It has a nice scent and texture but if you read the ingredients you’d change your mind.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Increíble producto!!!!!! Me encanta!! Llevo años usándolo y la verdad nunca lo dejare de usar, deja mi cabello hermoso y con un brillo hermoso…"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"There’s not really much to dislike about this price. The price point is great and often on offer in various supermarkets and places such as Superdrug and boots. I’ve tried a few in the range but this one’s my favourite - it leaves my hair feeling super soft and silky and it feels really clean. The only downside to this product is some of the ingredients I don’t love and don’t always agree with my hair care routine. All in all though, a really good, affordable product."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"Didn’t do that much to my hair. I have wavy, kind of thick, very long hair. I wash them 1-2 times a week and i felt my scalp did not like this shampoo that much. The packaging looks good but when the bottle gets empty it’s not practical anymore. You almost can’t put it upside down so you kinda leave a lot of product in the bottle."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,Mit diesem Shampoo wasche ich mir seit neustem die Haare und es ist sehr gut ich wasche mir ca 2-3 pro woche die Haare und jedesmal nach dem Waschen fühlen sich die Haare so gut an deshalb ist es ein sehr tolles Produkt und nur weiterzuempfehlen.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I struggle with my ends looking split due to putting heat on my hair and this product smooths them. Smells great, doesn’t leave any residue in my hair. Me and my husband love it."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is effective makes my hair smooth n soft. Has mild scent, smells like oil sometimes. Packaging is bulky and would have been better with pump. Great value for money. Good moisturizing shampoo"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"I wasn't happy with it. My hair was not better after using it with conditioner. Didn't make any difference, wouldn't make it easy to comb, hair was not shiny. I used better products than this."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I've been using the OGX Argan Oil and Morocco Shampoo for several weeks now, and I'm thrilled with the results. This shampoo not only smells amazing but also leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft and manageable. The argan oil in the formula adds a beautiful shine to my hair, and it has helped to reduce frizz significantly. I also appreciate that it's sulfate-free, which is gentle on my color-treated hair. Overall, it's become a staple in my haircare routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality shampoo that nourishes and revitalizes their hair"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"It’s fine. It’s a standard shampoo, doesn’t harm my hair but also doesn’t necessarily seem to help either. Given the option, I’d probably choose something else."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,Tried out a sample size while on vacation and honestly not a good shampoo. It didnt clean my hair as much as I would like since i have very thick hair. The travel size had enough for maybe one hair wash. It did smell pretty good but i wouldn't buy a whole bottle of this shampoo.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"It smells great, but the product itself didn’t do much for my hair. OGX shampoos are a mixed bag for me. On the positive side, they come in an array of delightful scents that make shower time enjoyable. They also offer a variety of formulations for different hair types and concerns, which is great for customization. However, I've found that their effectiveness varies. While some OGX shampoos leave my hair feeling clean and manageable, others seem to leave a residue or don't address specific hair issues as well as I'd hoped. It's a bit hit or miss in terms of performance. Overall, OGX shampoos are decent for the price, especially if you find a formula that suits your hair type, but it might take some trial and error to find the perfect match. I'd rate them as a 3 out of 5 for their affordability and fragrance variety, but inconsistency in performance keeps them from a higher rating."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"With these products, my hair does amazing, as long as it's deep conditioning. The bottles arent that big for the price. It always surprises me, the ""healthier"" ""more all natural"" the ingredients are, the more expensive. I had to stop buying this brand bc of the prices and how little the bottles were. And my girls even used the curl shampoo and conditioner"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! It smells divine and the scent lasts for a long time between washes! It cleans the hair really well without drying it out too much!
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"My experience with this product has been positive. It has effectively tackled issues like dryness and frizz, leaving my hair looking healthier and shinier. The pleasant scent adds to the overall showering experience."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"I used the original argan oil shampoo and it was just okay, then i tried this one and fell in love with it. so soft, it made my hair so shiny and silky and it smelled amazing. however, the scent is extremely strong so beware of sensitive noses!"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have curly hair (3b/c) and have used this shampoo with no issues. Not the greatest thing but very satisfactory for my purposes. The smell was alright, kind of a generic nutty rich smell."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I tried this hair product and didn’t think anything of it, but it’s actually really good! It doesn’t dry the hair out and keeps it hydrated and soft. The only thing I don’t like about it is that the bottle is so small. It won’t last long and in the long run, not as practical."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo is my favorite brand. I love that it has argan oil in it. It really does help penetrate the hair shaft and makes my hair nice and shiny, soft and silky. I use it twice and then finish it off with the argan oil conditioner and this product has never let me down. I love the way my hair feels after using it, swingy and bouncy. The shine can't be beat."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,Its a good product overall but it does seem to dry my hair out a little bit if you have scalp issues. If not its a good shampoo it does smell amazing and leaves your hair smelling clean.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,Always buy this for when i go on holiday and my hair needs the moisture and oils. Really nice shampoo lathers well and leaves hair feeling soft and clean

Worked very well on my husband as he has short hair that would get quite oily and his forehead would end up being shiny and oily later in the day. It worked from the first wash already and dried up oils without drying the hair or making the hair look dry. A very fresh fragrance as well, makes you feel invigorated."

Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control 2-in-1,4 / 5,"Arrived quickly and well packaged. I have previously used a fixing powder but not from the Maybeline brand. I loved this! Although the powder is very white (I had concerns about this) it blends in lovely and has a nice matte finish. It's lightweight and doesn't have the ""Talc"" feeling on your face. I have sensitive skin which is prone to flare ups and have had no trouble at all with this finishing powder. I will definitely be buying this again. Highly recommend! This is my own honest, unbiased review and I am not affiliated with the seller or the product in anyway. Hope this review helps, feel free to ask questions! :)"
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control 2-in-1,5 / 5,"I have tried what feels like a zillion different kinds of shampoos, and yet I keep coming back to Head &amp; Shoulders.

Highly recommend this shampoo, especially if you know a man or a teenage boy who wants more volume but doesn't want to smell feminine with certain shampoos that have a floral scent. This shampoo is extremely affordable."

Repair & Protect 7 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I bought this Tresemme shampoo and I decided to test it for a week so I can see some more results than just a one and done. First impression is I liked the smell, it wasn't overpowering and it didn't smell chemical or plastic. I took a shower and used it. Now I'm a cook in a kitchen, my hair gets dirty, greasy and lets face it, smells like a commercial kitchen after a shift. When I finished washing and dried my hair, I did not have any lingering kitchen smells. Plus, it lasted throughout my next day at work and I could still smell the scent- it wasn't overpowering either, just a hint of the smell that lingered and I didn't come home with still commercial kitchen stinky hair. Now, for the after a week of shampooing with this shampoo- I noticed that I didn't have a lot of buildup like I normally do, and I did not have a bunch of hair coming out in clumps (this is a problem I've been dealing with). So, I do believe that this shampoo will be staying in my hair routine for sure."
Repair & Protect 7 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I like the scent, the texture, packaging and value but really I don’t know if it is really very good.

Moroccanoil Hydrating Shampoo 250mL,1 / 5,"I bought that shampoo because of all the hype. Being Moroccan, I know that argan oil is really amazing for hair. However, the amount of argan in it is simply dishonest. Regarding the composition it is a very toxic product. I tried their other products and I found myself really deceived that I fell into this hype. I'd rather get simple argan oil but definitely not from this brand as their products seem to be dangerous and filled with endocrine disruptors."

After drying, the hair is soft, silky, moisturized and fragrant. The composition contains keratin, fatty acids, and argan oil antioxidants. Another huge advantage of this shampoo is that it does not contain harmful components such as parabens, sulfates and phosphates. In addition, the shampoo preserves the pigment of colored hair."
Moroccanoil Hydrating Shampoo 250mL,4 / 5,"Thanks to the argan oil and vitamins, my hair feels pleasant to the touch, soft, and nourished. It's a lifesaver for my dry hair, but I also have an oily scalp, so it's not the best match for me since my hair gets greasy by the end of the day, that's why I'm taking off one star. But that's just my quirk. Additionally, the shampoo has a delightful sweet scent and comes in convenient packaging."

Moroccanoil Hydrating Shampoo 250mL,5 / 5,"LA REALIDAD DE FACEBOOK Donde se mandan solicitud de amistad y en la calle no se saludan. Donde las relaciones son perfectas. Donde los infieles buscan pareja. Las mentiras parecen realidad. Donde tus enemigos son los que más ven tu perfil. Donde tu familia te bloquea. Donde escribes algo y ya es indirecta para alguien, o que todo lo que escribes es acerca de ellos. Donde te comentan solo para quedar bien y en realidad piensan otra cosa. Donde la falsedad abunda. Donde si usas fotos con filtros se burlan, nada más por que ella se creen más bonitas que tú. Donde él o ella piensan que son perfectos y buscan como joderte la vida, con lo que tú publicas. Si publicas que eres feliz, les arde, les duele y buscan como difamarte. Donde no soportan ver publicaciones tuyas donde vas a la playa o al cine por que estás presumiendo. Por eso Facebook es un arma de doble filo o de doble cara. En persona eres una cosa y en Facebook eres otra."

Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,I have fine really straight hair that needs some help in the volume department and this stuff seems to help pretty well. The smell isn’t my absolute favorite but it is still pleasant and does the job!
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"I leave this shampoo in all my kids bathrooms. It is a lower priced shampoo and comes in large pump containers, which I love. Kids seem to like it. Great to leave in outdoor shower"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,2 / 5,"my hair is so thick to begin with and i used this in hopes to tame my volume, it unfortunately made my hair very frizzy and huge and i had to switch. My sister who has fine hair loves this shampoo since it offers her the volume she desires"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"Every time I use this shampoo, someone asks me what I am doing differently because they love my hair. I adore the smell too. This product always leaves me feeling clean and fabulous!"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,It’s a decent product. Not the best detangler but it’s better than some of the big names. It doesn’t have any smell if that’s a worry for some. It’s not in my rotation
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,This is by far the best shampoo I have bought! It not only smells so good but it does wonders with my hair. When using this I don’t have to wash every day
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"Very good shampoo for me, try it and never forget for u 🐱 never try- never get something good 👍 there is a lot of choice and anything for the hair, try it👍"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,It really does help with volume. A lovely smell as well. Although I have noticed that if you try to keep your hair wrapped up too long it seems to make your scalp feel oilier than usual.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have a rotation of different shampoos that i use, and aussie is always part of it. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel after it dryes. I will never complain of this brand"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I do not typically go for drug store shampoos, but when I have to I like to choose this one because the smell lasts forever and it feels like it actually cleans the hair"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"I hardly use drug store shampoos anymore, but this one is always a go to when I need something. I used this for over 10 years in a rotation of a few other shampoos, and loved it."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,"I didn't like this shampoo. I really loved the smell, but the effect after I rinsed it from my hair was awful. My hair felt *extremely* dry, like it had every ounce of moisture stripped from it, and the texture was like hay, even though my hair was wet. I have oily hair, and this was after I hadn't washed my hair in 3 days, so it was pretty dirty. The only reason I'm rating this 3 stars is because my hair didn't dry with that horrible texture. It was probably only my conditioner (different brand), that saved it. I might use this one more time just to see if I have a different result, but I am very disappointed with this after just one, first time use. I've heard a lot of good things about Aussie, so this was a huge letdown, considering this shampoo is pretty cheap. I will definitely not be purchasing this again."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,1 / 5,I am not a fan of Aussie products in general. But this shampoo in combination with the conditioner ruined my hair. It made my hair extremely dry and made it feel like hay. It also made my hair lose it’s usual shine. 0/10 would not recommend!
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo deep cleans and adds volume without stripping the hair or weighing it down. It has a nice light fragrance and leaves hair soft and manageable.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo, it gives my hair lots of volume, it smells amazing and my hair feels so clean after using it. I would definitely recommend it and the conditioner."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,If I absolutely have to reach for a drugstore product this is on my list. The smell is incredible. Does help with volume and gives a nice lather.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I'm not sure this really gave me anymore volume, but it was a nice shampoo and smells great! A decent price point and easily available at your local store. Recommend!"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I feel like this worked very well for me. I usually only wash my hair once or twice a week and when I first used this product it seemed to have added a lot more bounce to my already naturally curly hair. My hair is straighter towards the roots but curls at the ends, but when I use this product my hair started to curl a little more upward towards my roots."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,I don’t know if I have noticed a different in my hairs volume because it takes a lot to get it there but the smell is absolutely amazing and makes my hair feel soft and healthy!
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,Works well and smells really good. Makes my hair soft after using it and after blow drying my hair. Would recommend.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,2 / 5,I personally don’t love this shampoo or the conditioner. I felt like it would leave a residue on my hair. It also dried my blonde dyed hair out.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,I have very fine hair and this product gives it so much volume. It also leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling great.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"I remember using Aussie brand in middle school because they smelled so good. This is not my favorite shampoo now, but it is definitely better than some other shampoos."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,Currently using this shampoo along with the matching conditioner. Very nice stuff and it smells good. Went through the shampoo kinda quickly cause it’s a more narrow bottle
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,I like Aussie product for it leaves my hair soft smooth and manageable. It's water based so it's easy for me to wash my 4C hair. Smells great & it's very affordable .
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"Not much to dislike. Keeps my hair fresh until my next wash. Smells good too! My hair is natural straight and not much maintenance so, this works great for me!"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,I love the Aussie products because of the smell . Now with that being said the volume shampoo I really can’t tell a difference from using it or any other shampoo. I have very fine thin hair so it’s hard to find anything that doesn’t weigh down my hair because it seems like everything weighs down my hair. Other than that I love all their products and like I said it could just be I have unmanageable hair. That’s probably why I keep it up all the time
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,"The smell definitely was a plus, but after using it. I found my hair becoming more dry and coarse. I stopped using it because my hair is fine and thin. I didn’t feel as it was helping my hair."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Smells A-MA-ZING til the next wash, not just after blowdrying...you can literally feel the clean while you're rinsing...it definately gives you a day between washes if need be....24hour+ results...paired with the conditioner of the same name and its HELLO GORGEOUS...."

Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I enjoy using the 7 in 1 miracle shampoo. It leaves my hair so soft and healthy looking. I love the scent of Aussie shampoos. I purchase the bigger bottle and it is still a great price value.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I absolutely love Aussie, if your hair is always frizzy I recommend you trying the 7 in 1 miracle, it helps with the frizz and does not weigh your hair down, and it smells so good and I love the apricot, the ingredients will not harm you, and the price I feel is very fair for the 778 ml I paid 7 dollars!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I am so impressed for a cheap shampoo! I would have never guessed I would find something that worked so well in a family dollar store. I would only purchase salon named shampoos matrix,redken, Amika, etc well I gave this collection a try and I am so glad I did! I even get compliments on how healthy my hair looks now. It’s so shiny and softer! I love the smell of this as well which is another plus. Definitely highly recommended product!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,I think this is a good shampoo for the price point. It left my hair feeling really clean but still soft and not dried out like some shampoos do. It also has a really nice smell.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,The scents is strong at first when applied to hair but after you wash your hair and it dries it definitely leaves such a nice settle smell. The price for 778 ml of shampoo is definitely worth it. This shampoo always tends to last me awhile and well I have long hair. Great for all sorts of hair:)
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"A great shampoo for the price. I do have really oily hair, and it doesn't help much with that, but it still cleans it well. The bottle is huge, with a pump, and smells light and tropical. I like it."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"A nice shampoo for a whole family (except kids). The scent is super pleasant. A small drop is enough to get a decent amount of foam. Cleans well, will buy again"

Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is not only one of my favorite smelling shampoos, but you can get it for super cheap, too! It works just as good as the more expensive brands, and it doesn't make my hair feel brittle!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I received coupons in the mail to get some Aussie products for free. I picked the Total Miracle shampoo apricot scent. Plus, I also picked out the conditioner in apricot and the shampoo and conditioner in the avocado scent. When I first used the apricot shampo, I was very impressed with the scent. It had a refreshing apricot and citrus smell to it. The scent engulfed my bathroom leaving it smelling so good. This shampoo is very creamy and feels silky-smooth. When I applied it to my hair it lathered up really well. In fact all you need is a small amount. I add a quarter size drop in my hand and it gets really sudsy. It rinses out very easily and doesn't leave a residue behind. Before I started using this product my hair was falling out really badly. And now my hair has stopped falling out and looks very healthy. It helped hydate my hair and took away the frizz. After I blow dry my hair, my hair feels so soft and my fine/thin hair has volume. My hair also blow drys more quickly since using this brand. After I take a shower and use the apricot scented shampoo and conditioner I feel so energized and rejuvenated. Citrus scents seem to do that to me after using them. I have been buying this ever since I used the shampoo I received with the free coupon. Infused with Apricot and Australian Macadamia oil. Aussie Total Miracle Shampoo is made with ingredients including Australian aloe, jojoba oil, and sea kelp. These ingredients help to support healthy hair growth, soothe the scalp, prevents hair loss, controls dandruff, and strengthens your hair and adds shine to dull hair."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,This Shampoo smells heavenly and makes my hair feel luxuriously smooth! Not to mention that is affordable and available at most superstores. The apricot scent really makes me feel like its summer when I use it!
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo does a lot of different things for your hair. If you’re not sure what your hair needs, this is a good option to pick up that will cover most issues. Not to mention the apricot scent is delicious!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"Not only is the sweet apricot 🍑 smell great in a morning shower, but the shampoo is too! Leaves my hair bouncy and well moisturized. Definitely a new must have 😊"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"This is one of the best shampoos out there, and you can never go wrong for less than $6 a bottle! It really is a miracle! It leaves my hair touchable soft, clean (I shampoo 2-3 times a week), and smells great too. The only reason I don’t give it five stars is because it does tend to pull the color out of my hair (dyed) but otherwise it’s amazing!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Around Christmas and 2021, 2022. I died my hair with peroxide which was a bad decision. I found this shampoo and I used it and it worked great on my hair. It helped with my damaged hair and it made my hair very moisturized and smells amazing.￼"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,"I like this shampoo because it’s cheap and it works okayish, I think to say it’s a miracle is little but exaggerated 😂, if I don’t use conditioner I won’t even be able to detangle my hair , it cleans really well but you MUST use a very deep conditioner after, otherwise your hair would look like a bird’s nest 🪹"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,I buy this all the time! I love it so much. It makes my hair so soft and it smells amazing. I highly recommend this for anyone who has super greasy hair like I do.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I really like this shampoo !!, it smells good and stays on the hair for a long time. And is not expensive, it cleans well and doesn't dry out the hair"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve tried a lot of different shampoos (even expensive, fancy brands) and none of them have been better on my hair than this one! It leaves my hair feeling refreshed and actually full of volume, plus it smells soooo good!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo is a marvel. It cleans the hair super well and has a very rich scent. My only complaint would be that the fragrance is quite strong but that's a matter of taste. Totally recommended.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,Aussie makes very affordable and readily available products that can be purchased just about anywhere. They have a heavy perfume scent that is pleasing and smells good throughout the day. The ingredients aren’t sulfate or silicon free but it suds well and rinses out easily.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"My regular shampoo wasn't available at the store and i saw this one. I figured I'd give it a shot. Well it's safe to say this is my new favorite. It smells so good and the scent is one of the few that actually stays in my hair after i shower. It makes my hair really soft and tangle free. Which i struggle with usually since my hair goes down to my waist and it's thick. I am really loving this! And it is a really good price. I paid 8 or 9 bucks for it and it's a huge bottle. My other favorite thing about it, is it has a pump so i just put it in it's spot and don't have to mess with it to get my shampoo!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I started out using miracle curls which I LOVED. Then, I was told to try the total miracle, and my hair loves it. It makes my hair so soft, it looks healthy and hydrated, and I rarely have any knots or tangles when I use the total miracle. I would highly recommend, especially for people with curly/wavy hair!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Across the board this shampoo checks every box for scent texture and price. Smells great leaves hair soft and shiny and less frizzy. If you buy the 2pack of shampoo and conditioner it is $12 for how big the bottles are that is a steal.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,1 / 5,I love the smell of this shampoo but it just isn't right for my hair. I have dandruff and I was hoping that something different would help but it didn't
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo smells so good!!! Super affordable for such a large size, can't complain! Cleans the hair well while still leaving it soft and manageable, definitely recommend I would say it works well on all hair types."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I like most all AUSSIE products. THIS IS THE TOTAL MIRACLE SHAMPOO IN THE SMELL WITH APRICOT AND AUSTRALIAN MACADAMIA OIL FABULOUS FRAGRANCE LEFT MY HAIR BOUNCY AND FLUFFY BUT NOT TOO MUCH VOLUME PLUS IT COMES IN THIS COOL PUMP BOTTLE FOR EASY DISPENSING WOULD RECOMMEND PLUS IT'S NOT HARD IN THE POCKETS EITHER PRETTY REASONABLY PRICED
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,"This smells so good !!! It makes my hair feel clean also makes it smell so good . It kind of leaves my hair hard to rub my fingers through in the shower . But conditioner makes it more softer !! My hair feels moisturized, shiny and healthy everytime I do use it . My hair doesn’t feel damaged . I’ve been enjoying this !"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"It smells really good ! I haven't noticed any difference in my hair so not sure what the total miracle claim is ! But it smells good , and it does clean my hair so that's the main reason I bought it."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Good shampoo really good for thick hair and super well priced. Love how much product you get. Great for oily hair or damaged
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,This is a average drugstore type of shampoo. I really wanted to love it and give it a try on my daughters hair. My two girls have Indian type of hair but not super thick. I thought after reading reviews it would be better. I like shampoos that have a added oil that people usually hate because it usually turns out wonderful on their hair. This was baseline basic. I wouldn’t rebuy it either. It does smell good and lathers decent but that’s about it.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,"Does not live up to it’s name. My hair looks and feels smooth, it gives my hair some shine but it’s not long lasting in comparison to my current shampoo. Like one day it works well and the next time it makes my hair greasy or fluffy. It has nice scent, but it also doesn’t last long. I do feel like it shows more of my split ends and where my hair breaks off unevenly. It’s not horrible shampoo and I would say affordable, but I’m not buying it again. And I feel like it gives different results every wash. Depending on how much to use, how long to keep in the hair and wash it off because it might give greasy look."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I like this shampoo and how good it makes my hair smell and feel. I don't care for the pump because it is hard to get all the shampoo out of the bottle. #haircaresecret
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo lathers easy, and washes my hair well, it keeps my hair feeling smooth and clean. Sometimes If I use it for too long it kind of builds up though and I need to use a different shampoo for a while."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,I just barely bought the Aussie miracle shampoo and conditioner yesterday so today is my first day of using it and the other reason why I gave it three stars is because it did come through with the shyness as well with the oils keeping my hair from looking frizzy but I still got more days to review about the product
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Only shampoo we use, helps my hair feel healthier and my husbands curls look better."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Love it! My hair is very delicate and entangles easily. This shampoo cleans it smoothly and makes it really soft. Love the scent as well.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,I really liked the product for the time that I used it. I can only use products for so long on my hair before I feel like it stops working.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,Nice shampoo and great for volume and moisture. Always use Aussie and if I ever switch I always end up going back to it.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,1 / 5,Don’t do it! I thought my daughter had lice she was scratching and flakes of dandruff. I switched shampoos with her now I have. I had used the Avocado one for years no problems. This is garbage. I started reading reviews on here so many saying the same thing. Don’t waste your time or money. I am not sensitive at all never had this happen. [product:aussie-total-miracle-7n1-shampoo-and-conditioner-set-262-oz]

First of THE SMELL! oh my it's absolutely beautiful like a sweet holiday kind of smell and it last on my hair long after its been washed off.

Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Shampoo,4 / 5,A nice shampoo with thick lathering power. I liked the shampoo but not for everyday. The scent was nice. It rinses well. I didn’t see much shine though and combing my hair out was not smooth. I recommend as a basic shampoo.
Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Shampoo,3 / 5,This helped strengthen my hair a little but not as good as the biotin line. Still a good choice though and I buy for my daughter’s hair and she loves it!

Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Shampoo,5 / 5,"My hair tends to grow pretty fast so I’m not sure how much of an effect this has. I liked the smell and consistency. It creates a good lather.

My biggest issue is, because it's black, it can be a little messy depending on how you store it. We keep our soap on a small rubbery soap holder and the black bits of soap get stuck on it. You'll need to clean it off right away otherwise it builds up and gets harder to remove."

African Black Soap Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"have had bad acne for the past years. Im in my early 30's now. My acne is cystic acne mainly, and sits on my cheeks, and chin primarily. They are deep, red and take weeks to go away (if they ever do). I have tried switching my laundry soap, multiple face washes, moisturizers, natural oils (like coconut ), my make up and many spot treatments. Some things would make the acne a bit better, but would never actually clear it up. I saw some friends on FB talking about this soap. I found it here on amazon and this was the highest rated black soap I found. I figured, "" what do i have to lose? I've tried everything"". The price was also super reasonable. The bar is very large and I have sliced off chunks to use. So far- I have been using this soap for exactly 1 month. Immediately, I noticed the redness decreased. Over several days, I noticed I had no new pimples developing. After the first two weeks or so the majority of my acne was gone. Now, after one month, a lot of my dark scar spots are gone or seriously diminished. I have only a few remaining red spots. I have made NO other changes to my diet, make up or skin routine. I have only been using the soap 2x a day- morning or evening."

Zunächst einmal gefällt mir die Verpackung der Produkte. Sie sind ansprechend gestaltet und leicht zu handhaben. Das Shampoo hat eine angenehme Konsistenz und lässt sich gut im Haar verteilen. Es schäumt gut auf und reinigt meine Haare gründlich, ohne sie auszutrocknen. Der Conditioner ist ebenfalls sehr gut. Er hat eine cremige Textur und lässt sich leicht in die Haare einarbeiten. Nachdem ich ihn ausgespült habe, fühlen sich meine Haare sofort weich und geschmeidig an. Was mir besonders gut gefällt, ist der Effekt, den diese Produkte auf meine Haare haben. Nach regelmäßiger Anwendung sehen meine Haare gesünder aus und haben mehr Volumen. Sie wirken kräftiger und voller, was ich wirklich toll finde. Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist der Duft der Produkte. Sie riechen angenehm frisch und bleiben auch nach dem Waschen noch eine Weile im Haar erhalten. Alles in allem bin ich mit dem L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo und Conditioner sehr zufrieden.

L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,"I absolutely love this thickening shampoo and conditioner set. Its amazing and definitely helps to thicken my hair . L'Oréal Laboratories have created their first haircare range to give thicker looking hair wash after wash. Specially developed with Filloxane, the shampoo formula together with Fibrology thickening conditioner, thickens the look of hair and provides deep cleansing. This is a great addition to my hair care routine. The ingredients are safe to use on the whole family . My favourite is the fragrance. Its definitely value for money and i would highly recommend the loreal brand as its very effective and definitely works its wonders"
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,L’Oreal fibralogy shampoo and conditioner is great for a budget friendly volume set . It is great when using the shampoo as it doesn’t cause the hair to go all tangled and the conditioner leaves the hair soft silky and feeling like it has more body even when wet.. The smell is lovely and after blow drying the hair has some oomph. Definitely recommend for fine hair

L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,"I have very fine hair, this does add volume. I have tried other shampoos but keep going back to this, hair feels very clean afterwards too. My hair is quite dry but shampoos with oil in tend to make it look greasy. Love this"
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,not so much thickening but definitely makes my hair feels fuller. i love the elvive range and this one is one of my go-to (and the purple one) perfect !!
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,"This product is fantastic! I have thin hair which is generally just flat and hard to syle. When i do style e.g. curl it ... the curls just drop out within a couple of hours ... no matter how much products and hairspray etc. i apply. But this shampoo and conditioner gives my hair voloume and lift, it seems to make it more pliable... i can work better with it. Great Product."
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,this product really made my hair thicker and does what it says on the tin. the scent is fine it smells pretty good. the texture is like normal packaging is ok. and it is a bit expensive at £14 but it’s worth it

L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,Has prabens and sulfates so gives a nice feel but isn’t the best for your hair leaves residue better alternative is kerestase shampoo and conditioner masks
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,"After I gave birth to my son I lost lots of hair. Every time I brush it I would take the brush full with hair, after I used it I saw a significant change. Good product 🙂"
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,"This duo is very good, if I recommend one it is this one and the yellow one, they are good, they hydrate my hair, it does not cause dandruff and leaves it shiny"
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,3 / 5,I don’t understand the hype on this one. I normally use a different L’Oréal product for my hair and love it but this one isn’t the greatest. It doesn’t do what it says it does and it doesn’t smell that great.
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,3 / 5,Toimiva paketti esimerkiksi mökille otettavaksi. Pesee ja hoitaa perustasaisesti. Tuoksu miellyttävä. Pullot sopivan kokoisia mukana kuljetettavaksi.
L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,It’s not quite a fantastic as the more high end Kerastase shampoo and conditioner that I love but at a fraction of the price it’s a great alternative! Leaves hair plump and bouncy.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,The scent is smellious and it effectiveness is nothing but clean and smoth. It lathers up and works!! Its worth the price. Will buy again.hair feels great.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"For my girlies with dry, damaged, bleached, over processed hair you need this. The shampoo and conditioner are certainly an investment but an absolute must in your routine to keep your hair healthy and help it recover from harsh services."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love the scent and feel of this shampoo! Super luxurious and my favorite! It does need a double shampoo in my case but the scent is so good, I don’t mind the extra step."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Mon shampooing irremplaçable depuis plus de deux ans , parfait pour les cheveux épais et poreux . Laisse ma chevelure brillante et magnifique , odeur agréable"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"the gold standard of shampoos, pureology’s nanoworks gold shampoo is packed with shea butter, marula oil, and vitamin b1 for ultra dry and dehydrated hair. golden marula oil keeps hair soft and moisturized while a plant based protein keravis gives your hair ultra strength. and it doesn’t stop there, this shampoo also has a beautiful scent that lingers with notes of dewy pear, ylang ylang, and golden amber"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This product actually surprised me at how well it worked. It is a bit on the expensive side, but I have to say it is well worth it. It has an amazing scent and leaves my hair, super soft and shiny, allowing me days in between washing. ￼"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"The Pureology Nanoworks Gold Shampoo is my absolute favorite shampoo. Not only does it smell absolutely fantastic it makes hair the healthiest it’s ever been. It’s a bit pricey compared to others but so, so good."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"It is my favorite shampoo for the moment. Even though it seems expensive, but it lasts for very long. Hair looks shiny, healthier, easy to comb. I am picky about smells, but this one doesnt bother me."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo is great for color treated and damaged hair. It does not strip my hair of moisture and it smells great too. The bottle it comes in is a great size and value.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I. Love. Purology! I’m a cosmetologist and we used Purology products at the first salon I worked at years ago and that’s how I was introduced to nanoworks. It’s great quality. 🖤 Moisturizing for dry and dull hair. 🖤 Vegan 🖤 Smells Amazing It’s a little expensive but I don’t mind paying extra for something like a really effective conditioner. It’s worth it! I recommend spending the extra money
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"If you hair is dry, damaged and feels hopeless this is for you! It is well worth the $ and smells wonderful! The shampoo & conditioner are both very creamy and repairing. It will repair dry, brittle damaged hair. Also great as an occasional treatment."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have severely dry, frizzy hair that also gets oily at the roots extremely fast so it’s imperative for me to use moisturizing and hydrating hair products! I tried this shampoo because I heard it’s equivalent to the Kerastase nutrise line for very dry hair, as well as the Redken all soft for very dry hair. I really liked the way this shampoo cleansed my oily scalp but left it light weight instead of weighed down. Sometimes shampoos for dry hair will coat the stands with heavy moisturizing ingredients and I prefer volume at the roots. I also always run shampoo down to my hair ends because if I don’t, product like leave in conditioner etc with sit on my hair and will look an absolute oily mess. This formula was gentle enough for me to use everyday, and helped my hair be softer, less frizzy and more “buttery”. I would love to try the conditioner!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is amazing! I love all of the Pureology line, but this is one of my favorites! I have very thick, long type 2c hair that’s frizzy. This product helps smooth my hair and makes it easier to blow dry. ￼It also smells incredible, it’s very thick and lathers well. You use a very small amount and add additional water to your hair because it is so concentrated! I love the liters because I can put a pump on it and measure that way."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,The best from pureology line. Smells amazing and really is so great for over processed hair. Can make my roots a little greasy though so just be mindful but overall such a good value.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,3 / 5,"On one hand, the smell of this shampoo is incredible and cannot be matched. On the other hand, it made my hair incredibly greasy when I used the shampoo and conditioner together. My hair is fine and can get dry, so I usually appreciate a little hydration, but I have to balance this shampoo with a different brand conditioner to avoid looking greasy."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my absolute favorite shampoo! It is nourishing and hydrating and makes my dry, thick, curly hair look amazing. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a long time. It also smells amazing!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Big fan of Pureology. Usually use Strenght cure but tried this one this time. My hair are bleached and curly and I use heat on the regular. The formula is concentrated so you can use only a little and my hair feel healthy, shiny and soft! Might be my new favorite!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Works well, leaves no residue and there isn’t a ton of water so a little goes a long way. Even though it seems expensive, it lasts a really long time."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have very dry bleached blonde hair and it is hard to come across a good hydrating shampoo that wouldn’t weight down my hair. When I tried this product for the first time together with a conditioner from the same brand, I was impressed. My hair feels so soft and look sleek. I will continue using it and see the long term results!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my favorite shampoo on the planet! It dramatically smooths and hydrates my (dry, frizz-prone) hair and gives it such a healthy shine! A+"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have damaged, bleached, and dry hair. This shampoo + the nanoworks gold conditioner have helped my hair so much! It has helped me hydrate my hair without weighing it down. Well worth the price!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Pureology nanoworks is the unicorn of all hair shampoos! It’s great for colored hair and has amazing hair repairing abilities! The smell is phenomenal and stays all day long. The price is steep, but this is one product I’m willing to splurge on!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’m in love 😍 with this Purology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner! Shampooing and conditioning never felt so wonderful! My bleached/ Damaged/parched strands are being treated with absorbing Shea butter, potassium and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. My hair now has vibrancy, shine and volume! ❤️"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"From the first use I was delighted with this product... its effects are immediate, more hydrated hair, more intense color, and shine. When you just put it on, your hair feels a little heavy, but once you finish washing it, your hair changes completely."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I really like this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair sily and smooth , it is very pricey but a little goes a long way . I have highlighted/balyage hair so i use this and always rotate with another brand to switch up ."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"First there’s absolutely NOTHING I disliked about this product!!! NOTHING!!! I loved the smell of it, the way it left my hair feeling absolutely softer, smoother, silkier than ever when my hair was damaged beyond belief from all the bleaching I had done to it. Even after the first use you not only saw a difference but felt it as well. It helped restore what I had stripped away from my hair and helped strengthen and moisturize it back to health."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Quand j’utilisais ce shampoing, c’est quand j’avais des cheveux plus long et plus beaux! En plus de sentir bon, c’est vraiment efficace!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,This is a product well worth the cost. I had lighted my hair for my wedding over several and had a very short cut. Naturally I had breakage. This shampoo helped moisturize and smooth my damaged hair but ensured my new growth was healthy and strong.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"In the past, I had used the strengthening shampoo from this same brand. I did not really see much of a difference at all with it. However, after a couple weeks of using this shampoo, I’m obsessed! My hair has never felt better! I love the scent too! Highly recommend."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I’ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a month now, and I love the smell. It’s a little pricey, but it works really well on my highlighted hair. My hair was really dry before I started using this. It’s helped put moisture back in my hair. I’d definitely recommend this brand."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Is this worth the hype? And the price tag? To me, no. Due to a dermatitis issue I have been using sulfate free shampoos for seven years now. Typically I purchase Hask brand but I received this to try and to me it did not cause any discernible difference in my hair."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I’ve been using the nano works line for a long time and it’s the best shampoo I’ve every used. It’s brought my hair back to life every time I decide to bleach it or change the color and my hair is basically the healthiest it’s every been. :)
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve been using Nanoworks S&C for a few years now. My hair is way more manageable and healthy. I lose less, it breaks less, it doesn’t dry out from getting coloured. It also has great ingredients, I’ll definitely continue to buy this line!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,Do you want healthy amazing hair! Buy this right now !! It’s nourishing and so moisturizing! My hair is super smooth after using this!! Loveee so much!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Expensive but definitely worth the price. Very this consistency which I love for my long, thick hair"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I’ve been using this shampoo for over three weeks now. Before using nanotechnology, I used the Pureology Hydrate line, and to be honest, I plan on sticking with the hydrating line instead of the Nanotechnology for many reasons, one being the nanotechnology shampoo retails for $129 plus tax. The results have not impressed me that all hair feels the same as the hydrating line, and the smell of this nano line is horrible smells like plastic to me sometimes. Highlights and pros ✅100% Vegan ingredients ✅No parabens ✅all hair types ✅non and color treated hair ✅adds Shine ✅Great for dry hair ✅Reduces Frizz Cons ❌No budget friendly ❌smell like plastic ❌Bottle does not come with Pump [product:nanoworks-gold-shampoo]"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have thick, curly/wavy hair that has been a bit dry recently. I love Pureology, and have used their Hydrate line forever, so I decided to try this out. The shampoo smells great and did leave my hair feeling hydrated, but it didn't lather as much as I like. I tend to overuse product when there is no lather. I love the Nano conditioner, but unsure if I'll keep using the shampoo."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,Nothing compares. Best I've ever used. Hair doesn't get greasy fast. Feels luxurious and smells nice.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Feels absolutely incredible and smells even better! This shampoo is not like regular shampoos, it doesn’t make your hair dry and tangled. This shampoo softens pre conditioner. I really like it! It’s on the pricier side but it’s worth every penny!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I’ve been using this shampoo for a while and I can honestly say it has protected my colored hair from fading faster & leaving my hair soft and smelling nice :) I would definitely recommend this shampoo! 10/10!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best smelling shampoo ive ever used! It made my hair feel light n so clean. I really love how light n fluffy it left my hair . Definitely would recommend for people with dyed hair. It kept my color from fading super fast$ I would for sure buy again!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,3 / 5,"So here is the honest truth about  [product:nanoworks-gold-shampoo] which definitely made my hair softer and shinier.  After two weeks of using this my hair is the softest it has been in a long time. However, I only gave this product 3 stars because of the scent which was way too overwhelming for me and not in a good way. Thank you Influentster for sending it to me to try."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,Amazing I can’t say enough good things about this product it made my hair feel absolutely amazing! Definitely worth the High price point
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is simply amazing! Left my hair feeling silky smooth and smells great too! I'm very glad to have recieved this product and to have the opportunity to try it, otherwise I probably never would have had the chance to even know about it let alone use it. I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for a great product at a decent price."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I really like how clean my hair feels after a wash, it smells pretty good too. I have dry scalp so Nanoworks Gold Shampoo did help with that unlike most shampoos that leave your hair feeling dry after a wash."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Very lightweight, quick to lather, smells amazing, good for color treated, finer, thicker, and older hair."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I loved using this shampoo with the conditioner! Pleasant smell and it lathers really nicely. I have bleached and dyed hair and I noticed when I used this shampoo my hair was more vibrant and not as dry. I would recommend this shampoo line for dry or bleached colored hair!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I had been looking for a shampoo that would strip my hair of the color this shampoo seems to do the job. I notice very little color lost when washing hair. Makes a good lather.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,3 / 5,"This was fine. My hair wasn’t colored at the time, which might have helped my review. It left my hair feeling a bit heavy."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! It makes my hair silky and smooth and it smells delicious! It has a great lather. I always rinse and repeat and the second wash really does the trick! Pureology is one of my favorite brands and will purchase this in the future!
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"I've been using this shampoo for decades on and off. I'm sure this formula is totally not the same I began using all those years ago, but fortunately it seems to have stuck fairly closely to it's good formula that seemed to be developed around 12 or so years ago after it went thru it's big change. Anyway, this on Amazon did seem to be the real product, & I was thankful to find it on sale here. It replenishes the moisture in your hair. I use it to rehab my hair from coloring more often as I get older. It is great. I've seen so many reviews claiming this shampoo, or other great moisturizing shampoos like it, and/or conditioners, are making people's hair fall out. My opinion, not of course knowing these folks in person, but I'd like to venture out with some explanations of what is actually happening. I have very great thick hair. I was blessed with genetics in that regard, thank goodness. Since I began conditioning my hair at age 12, gobs, and I do mean literal gobs of hair come out whenever I wash and condition. I never worried about it because no matter how many hair ""wookies"" left behind (I smear them on my shower wall to prevent them going down the drain, kinda gross I know, but it saves having to fish them out if the drain with a coat hanger later ) but no matter the mass quantities of hair shed left behind, I've never had any thinning or shortage of hair. I've also been cutting my own hair since age 12, but the few times I've visited an actual hair stylist, I have asked them about the gobs of hair that come out when I shower. They've all said the same thing: that it's a normal sign of healthy hair. That's been my experience as well. So I'm just saying, if you use this great moisturizing shampoo, & you lose more hair than usual in the shower etc, please don't panic. It might seriously only be because this product is actually working. Now, I can't explain the poor people who've posted with huge thinning spots on their head etc., but I've even wondered if it might not be corporate sabotage. This is a great product, & it's become a staple in many people's hair routines, so it seems possible that a competing company might pay people to light up the review boards of competing products with wild posts warning about hair loss, preying literally on every girl's worst vanity nightmare. Who knows. The last possibility is that China & other countries slip in some fake product here & there, as I've seen in documentaries. But this seller here seems safe, & I at least have received what I believe to be the real product, & I think I'm on my 3rd bottle now. Who knows. I just wanted to clarify that indeed, as you moisturize your hair, with any good shampoo/conditioner, it smoothes the hair follicle & the hair. Making it easier for the loose strands to wash away. These are just strands that were going to be replaced by new ones anyway. But yes. There might be a period where you lose a lot more hair in the beginning, then as your hair catches up with the new smoothing shampoo etc, it evens out. But it's not a negative. Your hair will reap the benefits of being smoother, shinier, healthier. Also, hair growth literally has seasons. Mine grows longer in the summer but thicker in the winter for some reason. Some articles I've read suggest it depends on where you were born & the climate/seasons in that neck if the woods. Wild stuff. Anyway, just don't panic about the hair in the shower. Because stress absolutely will make your hair fall out. I love this shampoo & beg the hair fairy gods please don't mess with it. Let us keep using it. The scent is lovely, the quality is great, and I've got more of my natural curls back after a season of frying my hair to the point all I had were frizzed out waves. This shampoo helped bring it back to life."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,4 / 5,i tried this shampoo and conditioner after i did my highlights i must say it made my hair very soft like if i never did highlights. very shiny and bouncy and it smells good
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,The best shampoo ever! It leaves my hair so soft and healthy. It is a little pricey but well worth it! You can get it almost anywhere including Safeway!
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,I love the Nexxus shampoo when my hair is feeling dry and unhealthy. As soon as I wash with this it revitalizes my hair and leaves it feeling refreshed and shiny. It smells great and adds a lot of moisture to the scalp and hair.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo makes my hair feel so clean without making it feel dry and stripped! Suds up so nicely and cleanses deeply ! Leaves my hair feeling great!
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,Although this shampoo is a bit pricey it is a great value due to the effectiveness in helping my dry hair. Love the scent. The texture of the shampoo helps me control my hair. The bottle packaging is attractive.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"Bought the bigger version after trying it out! Amazing, my hair feels so soft after and I can tell it’s cleaning but moisturizing my scalp at the same time! Smells great and so worth the price . I have curly but fine hair and it works really well."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,I love this Nexxus Humectress Moisture shampoo when paired with the matching conditioner this is designed to help rescue and visibly repair dry hair this locks in moisture for 24 hours smooths hair for long lasting shine repairs dry hair this is salon crafted with caviar and a protein complex for 24 hour moisture this advanced shampoo treats each hair fiber and retains natural movement this treats hair with rehydrating essential nutrients to replenish hair fiber and helps it feel silky smooth my hair is softer shiner and more manageable this leaves hair revitalized without weighing it down giving it flexibility and suppleness and this smells amazing the price is affordable and it is worth the money
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"When choosing a shampoo, I was referring to the composition. It was great and I made a choice. I tried it for the first time. I wash my hair every day, but the consumption is not great. My hair is shiny, smooth and not frizzy. I think my hair became less brittle. The price was for a volume of 30$, I think it is normal for such quality. Convenient dispenser, thanks to which you can determine the amount of shampoo and reduce consumption."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,4 / 5,Have been using this shampoo for 17 years and have loved it even when they changed the formula to the ones that say caviar on the front. These always leave my hair clean and silky smooth with no frizz. I have fine hair so I use only a small amount because I will say if you use too much it can give you a flattening effect. I actually rent to buy the huge bottles of this with the pumps because those are the most bang for your bunch they will last almost a year if you wash your hair every other day.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,I came across this brand in a local store and had never tried it before. A quick google revealed it was quite a top end brand and I thought it as worth giving a try. I wasn’t too keen on the fragrance of this product but I did feel that it was good for my hair. I have normal to dry hair and found this really suited my hair. I felt my hair was instantly moisturised and I had a sleek finish after blow drying and straightening.

Dove Dryness & Itch Relief Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have used several shampoos and conditioners over the years, and some have been really great, but this one far exceeds the shampoos for 1 reason. For years, my hair would get greasy in about 18 hours after washing it. Along with that, my scalp would start to hurt. Out on a whim a few months ago, I used Google to try and find a shampoo that would help. I had no idea that an anti-dandriff formula was what I needed. I chose Dove because I was already using the anti-frizz collection, and I liked the way it initially left my hair, but the same problems still happened. So, the first time I used this formula, I was impressed. On day 2, I still had no grease buildup, and my scalp did not hurt. The smell is light and not off-putting, and my hair feels clean, like really clean."

Dove Dryness & Itch Relief Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,4 / 5,"I suffered from a mix of scalp build up and dandruff. Dove is actually one of the only dandruff shampoos that didn’t leave my hair with a weird texture afterwords. There are softening agents to help with that. However, with also having an oily scalp, I would use this shampoo frequently. This is just a PSA but DO NOT use a dandruff shampoo more than once a week. It will inflame your scalp with all the sulfates and hash chemicals. Overall this product does a good job, I’m giving it one less star (not because of my experience misusing it but) because the fact there are a lot of ingredients known to lead to hair loss and scalp inflammation. Just watch how much and how frequently you use this!"

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,This is perfect for blonde hair. It’s a very good purple shampoo. It’s getting a nice light clean sun and it’s very pigmented so it does neutralize the brassiness with pure. You get what you pay for what you’re paying for is top quality

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,4 / 5,i’ve been in desperate need for a purple shampoo. i feel like any would’ve worked but i bought the hydrate conditioner and figured i’d keep the same brand for both. this did make my blonde brighter. i just took a star off for the price point $36 for the smaller bottle but it does work! it does what i need it to but there’s definitely cheaper options that’ll do the same
Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,"Great formula and wonderful hair shampoo. My bleach blonde hair is stronger than ever. It does a good job for keeping away brass. But as cool ash blonde with dark roots, I would benefit more if pureology dropped a BLUE line"
Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,I bought this from Sephora after I got my hairs treated with balayage dark blonde hair color. Without purple shampoo blonde becomes Yellow and looks very weird.

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,3 / 5,Let me start out with I have tried every purple shampoo out there and this one is not terrible it’s nothing to write home about. It left my hair super dry and gave an uneven tone. It’s also super expensive and ola

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,2 / 5,"So I’m a big fan of the pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner but this blonde shampoo totally missed the mark for me. Being that I have blonde highlighted hair I am always looking for the next best blonde shampoo. When this came out I just had to try it, needless to say I wish I hadn’t. This shampoo completely stripped my color and made my pretty gold blonde highlights silvery/grey, which is certainly not what I was going for. I have never had a purple shampoo tone my hair grey to this extent. Normally they just relieve the brass tones and leave my hair pretty blonde. I would not recommend this product unless you have icy blonde /silver colored hair."

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,I received this product for a promotion with Influenster. I love using this blonde shampoo. I have used a few others brands and this one is at the top. It takes the brass out of my blonde and refreshes my hair in between going to the salon for highlights.
Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,4 / 5,This product is okay! It smells decent but I don’t love the ingredient list. I was happy enough with it but wouldn’t purchase.
Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo was very nice you could tell its great quality by how little you needed to use, so it's not mostly water. It also left my platinum hair very soft and silky. It doesn't leave your hair overly scented either which I like. I will buy this again!"

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,As soon as I get out of the shower my yellow blonde turns to icy blonde. The shampoo is super pigmented.

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo and conditioner it’s the best purple shampoo I’ve found so far and so much more gentle on your hair than the other ones, my hair is so soft after using it not looking like I need a deep conditioner after use like other brands… would absolutely recommend to anyone with blonde hair or highlight"
Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,Very good shampoo/conditioner combo. I used it until I ran out. I think it’ll work better if you have color treated hair. Mine is natural so a lot of purple shampoos just take the brass out of my hair but don’t make it bright. [product:strength-cure-blonde-shampoo]
Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,3 / 5,"This definitely makes my blonde hair more blonde and minimizes some of the more amber and orangey hues in my hair. However, it does dry my hair out somewhat. I'm a big fan of their more moisturizing shampoos that work better for me."

Herbal Essences Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"This bottle is the English version of the Herbal Essence shampoo with Argan oil. I have experienced there are two different types of the same hair shampoo with Argan oil I have bought, one in Boots and the other is Sainsbury's. One of them is very thick, oily and the colour is cream to yellow. After a wash, my hair was greasy. The second one is silky, creamy, and in a pearly white colour; and this one is really nice. It foams and cleans my scalp gently, and it lives my hair smooth. I also use the Herbal Essence hair mask"

Redken Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo 300mL,5 / 5,"Redken Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo is hands down one of the best ever color protection products. I color my hair all too often, and recently I have made the choice to go purple. I was using a different product that stripped a lot of the color out, so it left behind more of a pinkish purple color and not the vibrant purple I had started with. So I did a little research to see what color protection shampoos and conditioners work best for my hair type (over worked, heat styled, fine, and flat.) This was a very popular product as far as reviews go. I can’t see myself using another brand unless of course the scent is amazing. I’m not a big fan of the smell of this product."

Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo for Colored Hair,3 / 5,"I’ll start with the cons on this product. For almost $12 a bottle (for the shampoo, $17 a bottle for conditioner), I only got 6 uses from it. I don’t feel that is reasonably priced. It left my hair dry (even when it was still wet, if that makes any sense to anyone). The two combined did help bring a shine and vibrancy to my very boring brown hair. They both smell really good and lathers well. Overall, I just wouldn’t recommend if you battle dry hair on a daily basis, but if that’s not an issue and you’d prefer color assurance over everything- then this might be the one for you![product:nexxus-color-assure-shampoo-for-colored-hair] and [product:nexxus-color-assure-conditioner-for-colored-hair] ."

I really like the fact this brand advertising that they use no silicone and parabens but something in the shampoo made me break out, I still finished it. I have fine, uncoloured, wavy hair - so I felt like it didn’t really do much for me. I have purchased their Hibiscus line since receiving this and felt it did the same - nothing."
